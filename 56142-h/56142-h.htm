  <h2 id='ch01' class='c009'>CHAPTER I <br /> <br /> WHERE THE WILD GEESE FLY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>A flock of wild geese flying across the sunset
far away, remote, fantastic, the only living
things visible in a world filling with shadows,
lent the last touch of beauty to the vast and
lonely moors.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They’re makin’ for the pools of Cloyne, sir,”
said the keeper.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Fanshawe watched the flock pass and
vanish in the amber distance like a wreath of
smoke. Away to the left, covering themselves
with night and gloom, stood the hills of Glynn,
where the golden eagle still has its eyrie, and
the wild goat its home. From there, away to
the west, the great moors stretched to the hills
of Cloyne.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a typical Irish winter’s evening, the
sky threatening and forgetting to rain, the air
damp and filled with the scent of the earth,
near things indistinct in the gathering twilight,
and far things seeming near.</p>

<p class='c013'>From where Mr Fanshawe stood, with his
pipe in his mouth and his gun under his arm,
you might have started with a brave heart to
walk to the hills of Cloyne. Ten miles distant,
or at most twelve, they seemed, those hills that
lay thirty Irish miles away.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fanshawe was staying for the hunting with
Mr Trench of Dunboyne House. He had come
out to-day to have a shot at the snipe, and he
had not done badly, to judge by the weight of
the bag Micky Finn, the old keeper, was carrying.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” said the young man, refilling and
lighting his pipe, “we’d better be getting back.
How far are we from the house, Micky?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A matter of five mile be the boggs, sir, an’
siven be the road; which way would your ’arner
be chusin’ to take?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The road,” said Mr Fanshawe, and, followed
by Micky and the dogs, he struck towards the
high-road from Dunbeg which goes across the
moors white and straight like a chalk-line drawn
by a giant.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You were afther askin’ me, sir, what time
the letters came from Dunbeg,” said Micky,
as they stepped on to the highway. “Here’s
Larry and the letters now, comin’ as hard as he
can pelt two hours late, the blackguyard! He’s
been stoppin’ to drink at Billy Sheehan’s, or
colloguing wid the girls; musha, but it’s little
he cares who waits for their letters whin the
bottle’s before him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Fanshawe shaded his eyes, and with a
constriction of the heart watched the horseman
and the horse coming at a furious pace
and developing with magical speed against
the sunset. The sound of the hoofs, like the
sound of castanets in the hands of a madman,
came on the breeze.</p>

<p class='c013'>The horseman, a ragged individual with a
leer on his face, no boots on his feet, and a post-bag
slung on his back, reined in when he came
level with the keeper and the gentleman, bringing
his horse literally on its haunches.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Any letters for Mr Fanshawe, Larry?”
asked the keeper.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Begob!” said Larry, swinging the post-bag
round and opening it, “there’s letters enough for
a dozen, but I’m no schollard to tell yiz who thir
for; will y’ be afther puttin’ your hand in the
bag, sir, and takin’ your chice?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Fanshawe did as he was invited. There
was only one letter for him, all the rest were for
Mr Trench or members of his household.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not the letter he had been half expecting
by every post for weeks and weeks past, and
he opened it with a gloomy brow, and read it
by the light of sunset as Larry rode on and
the sound of the hoofs died away on the high-road.</p>

<p class='c013'>To be young, rich, healthy, good-looking, and
yet unhappy! No other magician but Love
could bring about such an extraordinary concatenation
of states.</p>

<p class='c013'>Love had done this in the case of Mr Fanshawe.</p>

<p class='c013'>As for the letter, it was addressed from
Glen Druid House, Tullagh, Mid Meath, and it
ran:</p>

<p class='c014'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Richard</span>,—I have only just been
informed that you are staying with my friends
the Trenches, to whom, through you, I send my
very kind regards.</p>

<p class='c015'>“This house is only some forty miles from
where you are now, and as I have a small house-party
coming on the 10th, the happy idea has
occurred to me that you might join us, if your
engagements will permit you so to do. You
will find shooting enough to please you, I think,
in the coverts, and the O’Farrel’s hounds meet
twice a week. You will also find a sincere welcome
from your old friend,</p>
<div class='c016'>“<span class='sc'>Selina Seagrave</span>.</div>

<p class='c015'>“<i>P.S.</i>—I am here, at present, by myself. I
would be quite alone were it not that I have
your cousin Robert’s children staying with me.
Bob (Lord Gawdor), Doris, and Selina my namesake.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Bother the children!” said Mr Fanshawe,
thrusting the letter into the pocket of his shooting
coat, and little dreaming what pleasant factors
in the making of his fate those same children
were to be.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was rather fond of children, as a matter
of fact, but he was in love, and he had been
deciphering Lady Seagrave’s old-fashioned caligraphy
in the hope of finding, like a flower
in a wilderness, the magical name of Violet
Lestrange.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you know anything of Glen Druid House,
near Tullagh, Micky?” he asked, as they trudged
along together in the deepening twilight.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sor,” replied Micky; “it’s be Castle
Knock over beyant thim hills. It was Mr
Moriarty’s in the ould days. The place went
to rot an’ ruin whin the ould gintleman died,
but they do be tellin’ me it’s changed hands
to an ould lady from over the wather.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is there good shooting?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shutin’!” said Micky, speaking more from
a desire to be amiable than from absolute knowledge.
“Sure, it’s not a gun you’d want there
at all, at all, for you could knock the cock phisints
down wid your fist. Phisints! ay, be jabers!
an’ woodcock an’ teal; and as for hares an’
rabbits, the groun’s is jumpin’ an’ runnin’ wid
them.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If nothing better turns up,” said Mr Fanshawe
to himself, “I’m not sure that I won’t accept
the old girl’s invitation;” and ten days later,
as you may have guessed from this preamble,
he did.</p>

  <h2 id='ch02' class='c009'>CHAPTER II <br /> <br /> PATSY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“Miss Kiligrew,” said little Lord Gawdor,
looking up from his slate and the multiplication
sum on it that wouldn’t come right.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Robert?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“William, the page-boy, was sent away yesterday
for stealing the jam.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go on with your sum,” answered the governess,
who was seated at the other end of the
table helping Doris, little Lord Gawdor’s sister,
to make a map. “This is the third time you
have interrupted me with frivolous remarks.
How can you expect to make your sum come
right if you do not fix your mind on your slate?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will in a minit,” said his lordship; “but
I want to tell you, he’d cribbed a pot of plum
jam, and he heard some one coming, and he popped
it in the copper in the back kitchen where the
clothes were boiling. Gran’ma said she never
heard of an act of such—what was it, Doris?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Turpentine, I think,” replied Doris, throwing
back her golden hair from her forehead, relieved
to escape for a moment from the monotony of
map-making.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Turpitude,’ I suppose you mean,” said
Miss Kiligrew.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, that was it,” said Lord Gawdor.
“What’s it mean?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wickedness,” replied Miss Kiligrew. “Go
on with your sum.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will; but I want just to tell you, he went
away yesterday, and gran’ma said to Mrs Kinsella
the cook she didn’t know what she’d do for a
page-boy, and cook said she’d try and get Patsy
Rooney, the son of the keeper, to come. He’s
that red-headed boy we saw carrying the rabbits
in the park the other day. My eye!” he concluded
with a burst of laughter, “won’t he look
funny in buttons!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go on with your sum,” said Miss Kiligrew
severely, “and don’t use vulgar expressions
before your sister. Who taught you to say
that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My eye.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“William, I b’lieve.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, it is a very good thing he was sent
about his business. Go on with your sum.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Gawdor did as he was bid, and there
was silence for a while, broken only by the
squeaking of his pencil on the slate and an
occasional clicking sound from under the table,
where Selina, his youngest sister, aged five, was
seated on the floor playing with a box of bricks.
They were in the day nursery, which was also
the schoolroom, of Glen Druid Park, a great old
Irish country house.</p>

<p class='c013'>Little Lord Gawdor’s mother was dead and
his father was in India. He and his sisters
were living with their grandmother, Lady Seagrave.
It was three weeks before Christmas,
and as Lady Seagrave had invited a house-party,
the house was in a state of upset owing to the
preparations. Downstairs rooms were being
cleaned and dusted, carpets taken up and shaken,
mirrors polished, and mattresses standing to
air before huge fires.</p>

<p class='c013'>All the fun of a general house-cleaning was
going on, and it seemed very hard to Lord Gawdor
and Doris that they had to sit all the morning
doing sums and making maps instead of helping
to increase the confusion down below.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve done my sum,” said his lordship at last.</p>

<p class='c013'>“When I have finished demarcating this
frontier I will look at it,” said Miss Kiligrew,
who had a paint brush in her hand, and was in
the act of tinting with red the boundary line
between Cochin China and Somewhere-else.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right,” said the boy; “don’t hurry, I
can wait as long as you like.” He left the chair
and, going to the window, he climbed on to the
window-seat and looked out at the park. He
had scarcely been a minute at the window when
he gave a cry.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Miss Kiligrew—come here, quick!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The governess and Doris left the table and
came to the window.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s him,” said Lord Gawdor, pointing
to a small figure trudging across the park.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who?” asked the governess.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Patsy Rooney,” replied he.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How dare you call me from my work to
look at such nonsense!” cried Miss Kiligrew.
“Have you no regard for the value of my time?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Patsy isn’t nonsense,” replied his lordship.
“They say he can trap rabbits better than his
father, and he keeps the ferrits and helps to
clean the guns, and,” finished up Lord Gawdor,
dropping off the window-seat and coming back
wearily to the table, “I wish to goodness I was
him!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch03' class='c009'>CHAPTER III <br /> <br /> THE FORM IN THE WOOD</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>It had snowed slightly in the early morning,
and enough snow lay on the ground to take
the track of a hare.</p>

<p class='c013'>The ground told quite a lot of things to Patsy
Rooney as he made his way across Glen Druid
Park from his father’s cottage to the little village
of Castle Knock, which lies beyond the park a
mile to the west, where the Tullagh road meets
the road to Kilgobbin.</p>

<p class='c013'>Out in the open spaces the great feet of the
crows had left their mark clear cut in the snow.
Crossing them you could see the lesser traces of
the ringed plover, and all sorts of little birds had
left tiny footprints where the snow lay thin and
white as a sheet on the borders of the beech woods.</p>

<p class='c013'>All kinds of rare birds came to Glen Druid
Park, for the place had been deserted so long
that there was no one to trouble them, except
Patsy’s father, who was the keeper, and who
lived in the keeper’s cottage close to the Big
House.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Big House had been deserted for years,
but it was deserted no longer, for only that
autumn Lady Seagrave had taken it, and she
and her family had already moved in; and there
were, as I have hinted, to be great doings at
Christmas, and the whole country-side was
talking of the wonderful things that were to
happen when the “quality” arrived.</p>

<p class='c013'>By the “quality” the country people meant
the guests who were coming over from England.
Lords and ladies were reputed to be coming,
and bringing their hunting horses with them,
and there was a rumour that a bishop was coming,
too. Patsy was anxious enough to see the lords
and ladies, but he was more anxious still to see
the bishop; what such a thing was like he could
not in the least imagine. He could have asked,
but he didn’t: firstly, because he was a person
of such little importance that no one would have
been bothered answering him; and secondly,
because he did not want to spoil the sight when
it came by knowing what it would be like
beforehand. He thought it was some sort of
animal.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was going through the beech woods now
at a “sweep’s trot” to keep himself warm.
He had an old stake plucked from a fence in his
hand, and as he ran he would every now and then
twirl the stake round his head and give a “whoop”
that sent the startled birds fluttering through
the branches and the rabbits scuttling through
the withered fern.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was not going through the thick of the
wood, but down a broad drive that was the
shortest cut to the village; and he did not twirl
the stake round his head and whoop for the fun
of the thing, but to keep up his courage. For
the drive was just the place where the “carriage”
was always met.</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy’s uncle had seen the “carriage,” or said
he had. So had a lot of other people. It was
a hearse with plumes, driven by a man without
a head, and it was supposed to haunt the
grounds of Glen Druid Park, sometimes even
in daylight.</p>

<p class='c013'>The horrible thing about it was that when
the man without the head saw you, he made
straight for you; and, if he overtook you, down
he would get and bundle you into the vehicle
and drive off, and then you were done for.</p>

<p class='c013'>The snow on the drive, like the snow on the
grass of the park, showed all sorts of little footprints.
Tracks of hares and rabbits and the
trail of a stoat, Patsy knew and could distinguish
them all. Though he could neither read or
write, he knew the habits and names of all the
wild animals and birds that were to be seen in
the woods and ways around; he knew all the tales
about the fairies that lived under the ferns in
the glens, and the cluricaunes that cobbled the
fairies’ boots. He had never seen a cluricaune
or a fairy, but he believed in them, notwithstanding
the fact that he had a very sharp and practical
mind where the ordinary business of life was
concerned.</p>

<p class='c013'>Suddenly Patsy came to a stand close to the
trunk of a great beech tree. He had caught a
glimpse of something in the wood on the right-hand
side of the drive.</p>

<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c000' />
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch04' class='c009'>CHAPTER IV <br /> <br /> CON COGAN</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>It looked like a heap of old clothes at first sight,
then he made it out to be the figure of a man
on his knees engaged in taking a rabbit from a
snare.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was a forlorn-looking man in tatters, and
with long hair that hung over his shoulders, and,
bent down there amidst the withered ferns, and
under the shadow of the tree branches, he looked
not unlike a gnome or the ghost of a robber;
but he did not frighten the boy, who recognised the
figure at once as that of his uncle, Con Cogan.</p>

<p class='c013'>Con Cogan had once been the blacksmith at
Castle Knock, but he had sold his business and
taken to bad ways, and he was now the terror
of the country-side. He had no house of his
own, but just lived as he could, sleeping in barns
and hayricks, sometimes begging his food, sometimes
stealing it. He was suspected of being
a highway robber, but he had never been caught
in the act; and though a good many people
knew things about him that would have sent
him to prison, they never told: not because they
had any special love for him, but because they
were afraid. It was said that he had the evil
eye, and that if he cast a “black look” on a
person it would be all over with them and they
would never do another day’s good. Besides
this, he always carried a blackthorn stick with
knobs on it; there were seven notches on the
handle of it, and people said that every notch
stood for a man he had killed.</p>

<p class='c013'>As the boy stood watching his uncle, the
latter suddenly rose up with the dead rabbit
he had caught in his hand, and seeing his nephew
gave him good-morning.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And where are you off to, Patsy?” said he.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m going on an arrand,” replied Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And where’s that?” asked Con, as he stuffed
the rabbit into the pocket of his old overcoat,
and took up the blackthorn stick he had dropped.</p>

<p class='c013'>“To Castle Knock,” replied Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And what are you going to do with yourself
when you get to Castle Knock?” asked Con.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m goin’ to do me arrand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Blisther you and your arrands!” shouted
his uncle. “Talk English, will yiz, or I’ll prod
the sinse out of you with the end of me blackthorn
stick!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ohone!” cried Patsy. “Sure, it’s skinned
alive I’ll be if I’m not back by twelve with the
ca’tridges for the guns that’s waitin’ at the
post-office with the lethers for the Big House.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“So they’ve made you the postman,” said Con.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bob Murphy’s laid up with the rheumatism,”
replied Con’s nephew. “Crool bad he is; and
me father says to me: ‘Away wid you, Patsy,
to Castle Knock for the lethers, and ax thim has
the ca’tridges for the guns come from Dublin,
and fetch thim if they have. And if you drop
wan of them it’s skinned alive you’ll be, or me
name’s not Micky Rooney.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, he did, did he?” said Con.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Them’s were his words,” said Patsy; “so
I must be runnin’ on me arrand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, you must be runnin’ on your arrand,
must you?” asked Con in a meditative tone.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I must.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And your daddy said he’d skin you alive
if you weren’t quick, did he?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He did.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, it’s I that’ll be skinnin’ you dead in
two ticks if you don’t hould your whisht and
be doin’ my bidding.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ohone!” wailed Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Whisht!</span>” shouted Con.</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy became dumb. He would have darted
off like a rabbit and tried to escape by running,
only he was afraid of being brought to earth by
Con’s blackthorn stick hurled after him, for Con
was a terrible marksman, and he had been known
a kill a pheasant thirty paces off with no other
weapon than his deftly-flung stick.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m not wishful to get you in trouble,
Patsy,” said Con, “it’s not that I’m after; so
I’ll just be walkin’ beside you on the way to
Castle Knock, and I’ll give you the slip before
we catch sight of the village, for there’s a policeman
there I’m not wishful to meet, and it’s
livin’ in an old tree I am to keep out of his way.
What I want to ask you is, when are the quality
comin’ to the Big House?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They’re comin’ before Chris’mas,” replied
Patsy. “Lords and ladies and horses and
bishop and all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And who’s staying at the Big House now?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Old Lady Seagrave and her gran’childer,”
replied Patsy, as he trotted beside his uncle.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And how many gran’childer has the old
lady?” asked Con.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Three,” replied Patsy. “There’s the little
lord; he wears putty leggin’s and a shootin’
coat an’ all, and he only nine; and there’s Miss
Doris, wid the long gold hair, and she’s eight;
then there’s Selina.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s that?” asked Con.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Selina.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And what the divil’s Selina?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The baby; leastways, they call her the baby.
Selina’s her name, and she’s five; she gets in
the coal-scuttle when she has the chanst, she’s
that small and over-bould. Biddy Mahony is
their nurse, and she told me all about them.
They eats off china, wid silver forks.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Silver forks, did you say?” asked Con.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, and spoons.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Patsy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s thrubled with thinkin’ I am.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And what are you thinkin’ about?” asked
Patsy anxiously.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I was thinkin’,” replied Con, “that if you
were inside the Big House and I was outside
you might maybe hand me out wan or two, or
maybe three, of thim silver spoons and forks.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But, sure, that would be stealin’,” said Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who said it wouldn’t?” answered Con.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was no reply to be made to this, so
they trudged along in silence.</p>

<p class='c013'>They had not gone more than two hundred
yards when Con left the drive and turned down
a path to the right.</p>

  <h2 id='ch05' class='c009'>CHAPTER V <br /> <br /> THE MAN IN THE TREE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“Sure, this isn’t the way to Castle Knock!”
cried Patsy, drawing back.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And who said it was?” replied Con, seizing
him by the hand. “Is it geography you’d
be teachin’ me, or what ails you at all, at all?
Come on wid you now, or it’s the knock without
the castle you’ll be getting in a minit.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Uncle Con,” said Patsy, when they had gone
some distance, “where are you taking me?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come along and you’ll see,” replied Con.</p>

<p class='c013'>A moment later, to the boy’s relief, Con struck
into a path to the left, and they found themselves
in a little glade in the centre of which stood the
remains of a great oak.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Here we are,” said Con; “I’ve brought you
to see Paddy Murphy, who’s hidin’ from the
police.”</p>

<p class='c013'>All the branches of the oak were gone and just
ten feet of the bole remained, and it looked like
a great stilton cheese the centre of which has
been scooped out and eaten.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Are you there?” cried Con, halting about
ten paces from the oak.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Faith, and I b’lave I am,” replied a voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, the coast’s clear,” replied Con, “so
out you may come.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A scrambling noise came from the tree, and
a close-cropped head appeared over the edge
of the bole; the head was followed by a body,
next instant a fat little man was standing on
the turf beside Con and Patsy. He had a jolly
red face and bright, twinkling eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>It would be more correct to say that at first
his face seemed jolly, for when you had been
speaking to him a minute or so, the face of this
little man seemed no longer humorous, but, somehow,
dreadful.</p>

<p class='c013'>At first sight Con Cogan was a terrible-looking
man, but when you had spoken to him for a
while you did not feel in the least afraid of him.
It was different with Paddy Murphy.</p>

<p class='c013'>Con took the rabbit out of his pocket and
began to skin it, whilst Mr Murphy lit a fire
with dry sticks and a tinder-box.</p>

<p class='c013'>All the time they talked, and Patsy stood
by listening and shivering, for he knew that
the little man was a road robber who had been
sentenced to five years’ imprisonment only six
months before, and who, as the whole country-side
knew, had broken out of gaol and was in
hiding from the police.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I think I can fix it up at the Big House,”
said Con, as he skinned his rabbit. “Here’s
me sister’s boy, Patsy Rooney, knows one of
the servants. I’m thinkin’ if we shoved him
in through the little scullery window he could
open the door to us; there’s tons of silver spoons
and forks to be had for the pickin’ up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bother spoons and forks!” replied the little
man; “who wants spoons and forks when they
can put their hands on diamonds and jewels?
Sure, isn’t there a party of lords and ladies coming
over for Chris’mas, and what do lords and ladies
wear but diamonds and jewels?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But,” said Con, pausing with the skinned
rabbit in his hand, “supposing they do wear
diamonds and jewels, how are we to get them
off them?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Off them?” replied Mr Murphy. “Do
you suppose they sleep in them? Why, every
one of them undresses every night of their lives—not
like you an’ me sleeping in this ould tree—and
off they takes their jew’lery and puts them
in boxes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I see,” said Con; “and you’d be after slippin’
into the house when they were all a-bed, and
whippin’ off with the boxes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s my meaning,” replied Mr Murphy.
“Hand me the rabbit till I stick him on the
spit, for it’s hungry I am and I wants me breakfast.”
He put the rabbit to roast by the fire he
had built, and then he went on. “That’s my
meaning; but to get into the house there’s only
one way, and that’s to slip a gossoon through the
little scullery window; and there’s only one
gossoon of me acquaintance I’d trust with the
job, and this is him.” He suddenly pounced on
Patsy. “Now then, Patsy,” said he, “confess
your sins before I makes a freemason of you.
When did you say the quality was coming to the
Big House?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“This day week,” replied Patsy; “and don’t
be twistin’ me arm, it’s the truth I’m telling you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Are you wishful and willin’ to get through
the window and open the door to us?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No—yes—ow, let go of me arm!” shrieked
the unfortunate Patsy, whose arm had received
a sudden twitch from behind that nearly wrenched
if from the socket.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wishful and willin’?” reiterated Mr Murphy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes!” cried Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Will yiz swear to do me biddin’?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Will yiz swear to be ready and waitin’ for
us whenever we want you, which won’t be before
this day week?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now then, Con,” said Mr. Murphy, “give
me that burning stick out of the fire till I brands
him with the mark and makes a freemason of
him, so’s the pain will larn him what he’ll get if
he breaks his oath.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He was bending for the stick, when Patsy,
who was now on his knees, mad with terror,
made a frantic dash for liberty between Mr.
Murphy’s legs. That gentleman put off his
balance, made a grab at Con; Con’s foot slipped,
and Con, Mr. Murphy, rabbit and all, went rolling
into the ashes of the fire.</p>

<p class='c013'>When they had collected themselves and shaken
the cinders out of their hair Patsy Rooney was
gone.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch06' class='c009'>CHAPTER VI <br /> <br /> THE HIRING OF PATSY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Patsy ran and ran. He was so frightened that
at first he did not know where he was running
to, and when he came to his senses he was more
than half-way to Castle Knock. Paddy Murphy
had nearly scared him to death, and no wonder,
for the road robber was the terror of the country-side.
He had robbed the mails, he had broken
into houses, and it was said, that in a fit of rage
he had once roasted a live baby.</p>

<p class='c013'>That was, of course, nonsense, yet Patsy
remembered it; and when he thought of the
red-hot stick and the freemasonry business it
made him run all the faster, so that when he
arrived in Castle Knock he was out of breath
and nearly spent.</p>

<p class='c013'>He found the letters waiting for him at the
post-office and a great case of cartridges from
Truelock &amp; Harris, the gun-makers in Dublin.
It was addressed to Mr Fanshawe, one of the
guests expected for Christmas; and with the
cartridges under one arm and the mail-bag with
the letters slung over his back, he started across
the park, keeping a bright look-out for fear of
meeting his uncle.</p>

<p class='c013'>He crossed the park in safety, and came round
by the back way through the stable-yard to
the kitchen entrance of the Big House. As he
came through the yard Bumble, the watch-dog,
dashed out of his kennel and tried to “fetch” him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Bumble was a most extraordinary-looking
dog. He was as big as a sheep, and his head
was like a muff; to look at him you never could
have imagined that his great-great-grandfather
had been a greyhound, yet he had.</p>

<p class='c013'>His great-great-grandmother had been an old
Irish wolf hound. His mother was a bob-tailed
collie, and he had an uncle who was a Dandy
Dinmont. He was a mongrel, in short.</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy was not a bit afraid of Bumble, for
the old dog had lost his teeth and was quite
harmless, despite his ferocious appearance. He
took his parcels round to the kitchen door and
knocked; and whilst he stood waiting to be let
in, he looked around him hoping to catch a sight
of the children.</p>

<p class='c013'>The children interested Patsy a lot. He had
never spoken to them, but he had seen them at
a distance in the park, driving in the governess-cart
with their governess.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once he had met them all quite close in the
drive, and Selina had laughed and nodded to
him in quite a friendly way; the other children
smiled, but Miss Kiligrew frowned, and he heard
her say:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Selina, who is that dirty little boy you are
nodding to? Remember that you are a <i>lady</i>.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy was remembering this incident when the
kitchen door was flung open, and Mrs Kinsella,
the great fat cook, herself appeared before him,
with her sleeves rolled up to the elbow and her
hands all covered with flour.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, it’s Patsy Rooney!” she cried. “And
it’s you I’ve been sending to look for, and here
you are come of yourself.”</p>

<p class='c013'>She led the way down a stone passage into a
huge old-fashioned kitchen, where a number of
kitchen-maids were at work polishing pots and pans.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Them’s the letters,” said Patsy, laying the
bag on the table, “and them’s is the ca’tridges
for the gintleman that’s comin’. Don’t let
them near the fire, or it’s blown to blazes you’ll
be, and the house along with you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Take them away,” said Mrs Kinsella; “I
don’t want any such things in my nice clean
kitchen. Put them in a bucket of water, Jane,
and maybe they’ll be safe. Take up your letters,
Patsy, and follow me, for her ladyship wants to
see you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“To see me?” cried Patsy in alarm.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yourself, and no one else,” replied the cook.</p>

<p class='c013'>“O Mrs Kinsella, what have I been doin’
at all, at all!” cried Patsy, so flurried out of his
wits as not to be able to remember his sins.
“Is it the thraps I’ve been settin’ in the wood?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You come along,” said Mrs Kinsella, who
had washed her hands and rolled down her
sleeves. “You come along, and you’ll soon
see, only be sure, when she speaks to you, say
‘Yes, my lady,’ that’s all you need say; I’ll do
the tellin’ and the talkin’. Wipe your boots on
the mat here, and keep your mouth shut, and
not hanging open like a rat-trap with a broken
spring. Come here now till I brush your head,
for you wouldn’t go before her ladyship with your
hair standin’ up like the bristles on a broom.”</p>

<p class='c013'>She brushed his hair with an old brush which
one of the scullery maids fetched, and then she
washed his face with soap, and rubbed it with a
towel till it shone; Patsy, submitting without a
word, for he was too terrified now to ask questions.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now come along,” said the cook, when she
had made him fairly presentable. “And what
are you to say when her ladyship speaks to you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, me lady,” replied Patsy promptly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s right, and don’t forget,” replied
Mrs Kinsella; and, followed by Patsy, she left
the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy, who had never been beyond the kitchen
of the Big House before, followed his guide down
a long stone passage, up a flight of steps, through
a swing-door, then along a corridor from which
they entered a great hall. Patsy had never seen
anything like this, for the floor of the hall was of
polished oak, shining like glass; a staircase, so
broad that you might have driven a coach and
horses up it, led from the hall to the first landing.
Round the hall was a gallery, and under the
gallery stood men in armour, looking very ghostly
in the dim light.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were only suits of armour, of course,
but they were fixed so that it was impossible
to tell whether there were men inside them or not.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mrs Kinsella, ma’am,” whispered Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is it, Patsy?” answered the cook.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let’s go back, for it’s afeared I am.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You come along,” answered the cook.</p>

<p class='c013'>She knocked at a door, a voice answered
“Come in”; she opened the door and, followed
by Patsy, entered a pleasantly furnished room,
where a stately-looking old lady sat by a great
fire of holly logs which was blazing on the hearth.</p>

<p class='c013'>This was Lady Seagrave herself, and Patsy
looked at her with awe, for she was seventy-nine
years of age, and as deaf as a post. People
said she remembered the Battle of Waterloo,
and some of the more ignorant country people
said she had been at it. Patsy could almost
have believed this as he stood looking at her, for
she was a very fierce-looking old lady, with heavy
eyebrows, a large nose, and bright, piercing eyes.
She was beautifully dressed, and her fingers were
covered with sparkling rings; she held an ear-trumpet
to her ear.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This is Patsy Rooney, your ladyship,”
cried Mrs Kinsella through the trumpet. “I’ve
washed him and brushed him to make him a
bit respectable, for it’s wild in the woods he’s
been runnin’ this last two years, ever since his
mother died.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, this is Patsy Rooney, is it?” said Lady
Seagrave. “Hum! he looks wild enough still,
but I daresay time and soap will work wonders.
Is he honest, cook?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“As honest a lad as your ladyship would
find in the length and breadth of the land,”
replied Mrs Kinsella.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Have you explained to him that I wish him
to enter my service in the capacity of page-boy?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, your ladyship; I just cotched him and
washed him and brought him up to you. His
father is wishful and willin’ for him to enter
your ladyship’s service.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That may be,” replied the old lady, “but
I will have no one in my house a slave against
their will. Let him advance and answer my
questions personally.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Put your mouth to the trumpet, and when
the old lady asks you a question say ‘Yes, my
lady,’” whispered Mrs Kinsella.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now Lady Seagrave was so old that she sometimes
forgot things. She had quite forgotten
Patsy’s name.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is your name?” asked her ladyship.
“I have quite forgotten it. Speak up in a loud,
clear voice, and don’t shuffle your feet. Now
what is your name?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, me lady,” replied Patsy. He had a
mortal terror of the trumpet, he had never seen
one before. He half imagined that she used it
because she was so grand that it would be beneath
her dignity to listen to people in the ordinary way.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What did you say?” asked she.</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy imagined he had not spoken loud enough.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, me lady!” he shouted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>What</i> do you say?” cried her ladyship.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, me lady!” cried Patsy, nearly blubbering.
“I don’t know which way to be answerin’
you, with her behint me tellin’ me to say one
thing and me wantin’ to say another. Me name’s
Patsy Rooney, and it’s wishin’ it’s at the divil
I was!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Fortunately Lady Seagrave could not catch
the end of the sentence, but she made out the
name.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Patsy Rooney,” said she. “Well, we will
call you Patsy for short. Are you a good boy,
Patsy?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, me lady,” replied he.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And you would like to enter my service?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, me lady.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Your father is alive and your mother is
dead, I hear. I hope you have no evil companions
in the village, for young boys left to their own
resources, as you have no doubt been, often pick
up most undesirable acquaintances.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, me lady,” replied Patsy in a faltering
voice, for he recalled to mind Con Cogan and
Paddy Murphy and the promise he had made
them to help them to get into the Big House
and steal the jewellery of the “quality.” And
here he was in the Big House, and going to be
hired as page-boy—it seemed like fate.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you smoke?” went on her ladyship.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now an’ again, mum—I mean, yes, me
lady.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>What!</i>” cried Lady Seagrave. “Do you
dare to tell me that a boy of your tender years
indulges in that vile and pernicious habit?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure, it’s only the draw of a pipe I do be
takin’ to aise me mind now and thin,” cried
Patsy, “or when I’m out rabbitin’ in the woods
alone, for they do say the whiff of a pipe keeps
off the Good People.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Good People?” said the old lady.
“Who are they?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The fairies, mum—I mean, me lady.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dear me,” said Lady Seagrave, “I thought
no one believed in such rubbish as fairies nowadays.
Well, Patsy Rooney, I will hire you
for a month to see if you give satisfaction, and
if you don’t you will receive a whipping and
be turned away.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Leave him to me, your ladyship,” said Mrs
Kinsella, as she led Patsy away. “I’ll answer
for him giving satisfaction when I’ve belted
the fairies and rubbish out of him with a strap.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch07' class='c009'>CHAPTER VII <br /> <br /> MRS FINNEGAN’S BOY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“Mrs Kinsella, ma’am,” said Patsy, as he was
led along the corridor back to the kitchen, “Mrs
Kinsella, ma’am, what’s a page-boy?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’re one,” replied Mrs Kinsella. “Now
come along, and don’t be asking me questions,
for I have no time to waste. Here’s your room,
and here’s a suit belonging to William, the
English page-boy that’s just been sent off home
again, being caught stealing the jam; whip into
the suit, and when you have it on you come into
the kitchen and I’ll tell you what to do next.”</p>

<p class='c013'>She had opened the door of a small bedroom,
and there on the bed lay a page-boy’s suit, only
waiting to be put on. Mrs Kinsella closed the
door and left Patsy alone to make his toilet.</p>

<p class='c013'>A new suit of clothes was an event in Patsy’s
life. The suit he had on was an old suit of his
father’s cut down. He could not remember ever
having had a suit of clothes made for him.</p>

<p class='c013'>The clothes on the bed had not been made
for him, it is true, but they were nearly new.
The jacket had two rows of buttons down the
front, and the trousers had a red stripe down
the seams at the side. Patsy had never seen the
like of them before.</p>

<p class='c013'>He got into them, and then he found that
for all the buttons on the jacket he could not
button it. Holding it together in front he came
down the passage to the kitchen, and poked his
head in at the half-open door.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mrs Kinsella, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Patsy,” answered the cook; “what is
it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is it fun you’re making of me?” asked Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s jelly I’ll be makin’ of you with a rollingpin
if you give me any of your impudence,”
replied Mrs Kinsella. “What do you mean
stickin’ your ugly head in at the door and askin’
me such questions? Come in with you, and
give me no more of your sauce.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure, how can I come in wid me jacket
unbuttoned?” asked Patsy. “It’s buttons all
over I am, and not a buttonhole can I find to
stick one in.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come here,” cried the cook, catching him
by the forelock and dragging him into the kitchen.
“Do you see these?”—pointing to the hooks
and eyes down the edges of the jacket: “them’s
hooks and eyes. Hold up your head, now you’re
fastened into your jacket, and off you go to the
plate pantry and help Mr James, the butler, to
clean his silver; but first, before you go, run into
the stable-yard and fetch me a bucket of water.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy did as he was bid. He found a tin
bucket in the yard and carefully filled it at the
water-tap by the stable door. When the bucket
was full he seized it by the handle and was just
about to carry it back to the kitchen, when who
should come into the yard, with a goose swung
over his shoulder, but Micky Finnegan, son of
Mrs Finnegan, the woman who had the green-grocer’s
shop at Castle Knock.</p>

<p class='c013'>Micky was an old enemy of Patsy’s. He
was a long-legged boy—in fact he looked all
legs and arms—a huge mouth and a squint
were the next most noticeable things about him.
He was not good to look at, in fact he was good
for nothing except bullying boys smaller than
himself, and sometimes going on an errand for
his mother.</p>

<p class='c013'>The newcomer when he beheld Patsy in his
new attire stood stockstill, stared, and then
burst into a wild yell of laughter.</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy’s red hair bristled up like the spines
of a hedgehog, as it always did when he was
angry, but he said nothing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hurroo!” shouted Mrs Finnegan’s boy,
when he had recovered from his simulated fit of
laughter; “here’s Patsy Rooney burst out in
buttons; here’s Patsy Rooney drawing water
for the maids. Where’s your broom, Patsy?
Where’s your dustpan and brush? Have yiz
emptied the slops, Patsy, and made the beds
and turned down the quilts?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And what’s brought <i>you</i> out to-day?”
replied Patsy. “You’re afther your time; this
isn’t the fifth of Novimber, this isn’t Guy Fawkes
Day. Go back to your lumber-room, you stuffed
straw imige, and wait till they takes you out
and rides you on a rail.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Carrots!” yelled the other, who was not
gifted greatly with the art of repartee; “who’ll
buy carrots?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s ashamed of yourself you ought to be,”
replied Patsy, in a tone of virtuous disgust.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And why is it ashamed of myself I ought to
be?” queried the unsuspecting Micky.</p>

<p class='c013'>“For going about the country with your ould
gran’mother slung over your shoulder,” replied
Patsy. “You weren’t so fond of her when she was
alive, seein’ you let her die of starvation and
ould age, by the look of her.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This double insult levelled at himself and
the goose he was carrying took the wind out
of Micky’s sails.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who are you talking to?” said he, shifting
the goose from his left to his right shoulder,
and advancing towards Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The son of the ould jackass that grazes on
the common, I <i>b’lieve</i>,” replied Patsy, raising
his bucket; “though ’tis well known all over
the villige he disowns you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you see this fist?” cried Micky, shaking
a grimy fist in the other’s face.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I do. Do you see the water in this bucket?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I do.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, taste it!” cried Patsy, flinging it in
his face.</p>

<p class='c013'>The next moment the goose, swung like a club,
caught Patsy on the side of the head, nearly
stunning him, and the next both boys were
rolling on the flags of the yard fighting like cats.</p>

<p class='c013'>At this moment who should enter the stable-yard
but Miss Kiligrew, driving the governess-cart
with the children, and at this moment also
the kitchen door opened, and Mrs Kinsella
appeared to see what was keeping Patsy so long
in fetching the water.</p>

</div>
<p class='c012'>“Separate them!” cried the governess, reining
the pony in; whilst little Lord Gawdor, forgetting
everything but the fight in progress,
clapped his hands, calling out alternately:
“Go it, Pipe-stems—give it him, Carrots!” as
Patsy or his long antagonist came upwards in
the fray. Doris felt frightened, but interested;
as for Selina, she was in the bottom of the cart
and was fast asleep covered with rugs.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Separate them!” cried Miss Kiligrew to
the cook; “don’t stand there staring—separate
them.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Faith, it’s easy to say separate them,”
answered the cook, highly incensed at Miss
Kiligrew’s dictatorial manner. “Separate them
yourself.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Scarcely had she spoken when Patsy by a
supreme effort got Micky under, and kneeling
on his long arms began to screw his knuckles
against the jaws of his victim. The bully had
often done the same to smaller boys, but now
that the torture was applied to himself he did
not like it in the least.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who’s the son of the ould dunkey that
grazes on the common? Who’s the son of the
ould dunkey that grazes on the common?”
cried Patsy. “Answer up quick, or I’ll screw
you worse. Who’s the son of the ould dunkey
that grazes on the common?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am!” screamed Micky, unable to endure
the agony. “Let me up—you’re murthering
me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who’s ashamed of his son?” cried Patsy,
continuing the torture, and delighted to think
that little Lord Gawdor and Miss Doris and
the governess were there to listen to it all.
“Who’s ashamed of his son?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The ould dunkey is!” shrieked Micky.
“It’s I that’ll be murthering you some dark
night for this.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Name the biggest thief in the country,”
continued Patsy, undismayed by the other’s
threats; “out with his name before the ladies
and the gintleman.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Micky Finnegan!” roared Micky. “Mrs
Kinsella, ma’am, pull him off me!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lave him be, Patsy,” cried Mrs Kinsella,
who was enjoying the fun as much as little
Lord Gawdor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will in a minit, when I gets his family
tree out of him,” replied Patsy. “Answer up,
Micky Finnegan—who was your gran’mother?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The ould goose,” blubbered Micky, who
was now in tears.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Was she always good to you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She were.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ain’t you ’shamed of yourself for cartin’
her about on your shoulder to sell her when she
was dead of ould age and starvation?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Did she tell you before she died you weren’t
fit to black the boots of Patsy Rooney?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She did.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Did she spake the truth?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She did.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Up you get,” said Patsy; “and off with
you and ’pologise to your ould father for havin’
such a son.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He released Micky, who sprang to his feet
and tore out of the yard shouting what he wouldn’t
do next time he caught Patsy alone on a dark
night.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bravo, Carrots!” cried Lord Gawdor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bravo, Carrots!” cried Doris, as Patsy,
triumphant and grinning with delight, was led
off into the kitchen by the ear.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Robert! Doris!” cried Miss Kiligrew;
“what would your grandmother say if she could
hear you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I dunno!” replied Lord Gawdor; “but I
bet she’d have laughed if she’d heard that long
chap saying <i>his</i> grandmother was a goose.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch09' class='c009'>CHAPTER IX <br /> <br /> A FACE AT THE WINDOW</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“Here, Patsy,” said Mrs Kinsella, when she
had led him back to the kitchen by the ear,
“take this broom and away with you to the
top of the house and give it to Mary, the second
housemaid; you’ll find her on the top landing.
Go down the passage and across the big hall
and up the big staircase, and be back in a minit,
or I’ll scalp you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, ma’am,” said Patsy, and seizing the
broom he started.</p>

<p class='c013'>He went down the passage, crossed the hall
and went up the broad staircase, looking about
him and wondering at the splendour of the place.</p>

<p class='c013'>Poor Patsy, the staircase in his father’s cottage
was just a ladder. He had never seen a looking-glass
in his life, if we except the bit of broken
mirror used by his father as a shaving glass.</p>

<p class='c013'>The first landing was rather dimly lit, and
scarcely had Patsy set foot on it when who
should he see directly facing him but a red-headed
page-boy with a broom in his hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>He stared at this apparition for half a second.
Then promptly he put his thumb to his nose
and extended his fingers; the one in the mirror
did the same.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll larn you to make faces at your betters,
you ugly-lookin’ baste!” cried Patsy, his red
hair bristling like the back of a wire-haired
terrier. He brought his broom to the “present,”
the other did likewise; then he charged.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be to God, what’s that?” cried Mrs
Kinsella, as the smash of the great mirror,
followed by a wild yell of astonishment, reached
her ears.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I dunno,” replied Jane, the kitchen-maid;
“but it sounds like Patsy’s voice.”</p>

<p class='c013'>During the first few days Patsy made several
and desperate attempts to bolt back to the
freedom of the woods and life in his father’s
cottage. Then all at once he settled down and
took to his new life and duties with that adaptability
which is part of the basis of the Irish
character.</p>

<p class='c013'>The main cause in this transformation was
the influence of the children. Miss Kiligrew,
the governess, developing measles on the second
morning of Patsy’s initiation, and being removed
to the infirmary at Tullagh, the children were
left pretty much to their own devices, and the
first use they made of their freedom was to make
friends with Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>One evening Lord Gawdor having in a fit
of exuberance kicked a football through the
nursery window, and he and his companions
having been placed under arrest, Patsy, the
other servants being busy, was deputed to carry
them their tea.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was four o’clock and nearly dark, the wind
was rattling at the window (William, the gardener,
who did all sorts of odd jobs, had put in a new
pane), and the fire was flickering and dancing in
the grate and casting moving shadows on the
walls.</p>

<p class='c013'>By this light the man driving the pig to market
(he formed the pattern of the nursery wall-paper)
always seemed more alive; and if you got drowsy
enough and fixed your eyes on him, you might
see all sorts of things in fancy round the bend
of the road down which he was driving the pig.
All the pictures in the world were nothing compared
to this old picture on the wall-paper seen
at dusk by the flickering light of the fire.</p>

<p class='c013'>Doris, whose head, according to Miss Kiligrew,
was stuffed with “nonsense,” imagined castles
and knights in armour and swans floating on
lakes round the bend of the road; <i>why</i>, goodness
only knows, for the man and the pig were the
most commonplace figures on earth. Lord Gawdor
imagined a market such as took place every
month at Castle Knock; he could not imagine,
nearly so well as Doris—that is to say, he could
only imagine things he had seen.</p>

<p class='c013'>When Patsy arrived with the tea-tray, Doris
was seated on the hearthrug reading out of a
book of Welsh Fairy Tales. Lord Gawdor was
seated opposite to her with his knees up to his
chin, and Selina, spotless in a new frock, was
curled up asleep in the old armchair, a Noah’s
Ark book which she had just dropped lying face
downwards on the floor by her side.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve brought you jam,” said Patsy, nodding
at a huge pot of plum jam on the tray. “I
took it out of the cubberd when Mrs Kinsella’s
back was turned. I heard the ould—her ladyship
sayin’ to her, ‘You’re not to send them up
any jam, Mrs Kinsella, for they’ve misbehaved’
she says.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dear me,” said Doris, “what a pity, for
now we won’t be able to eat it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why not?” asked Lord Gawdor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Because grandmamma said we weren’t.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She only tould Mrs Kinsella not to send
it up,” said Patsy; “she didn’t say a word
about your not eatin’ it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I say,” said Lord Gawdor, when Patsy had
withdrawn, speaking with his mouth full of
bread and jam, “isn’t Patsy a——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Brick,” replied Doris; “I should think he
was.”</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c013'>That night Patsy went to bed very well pleased
with himself and his new situation. Lady
Seagrave, though severe looking, was kind and
had taken a fancy to him. He got on very well
with old James, the butler, and the other servants;
Lord Gawdor, Doris, and Selina had taken to
him just as he had taken to them.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had placed his candlestick on the old deal
chest of drawers in his bedroom and was in the
act of unhooking his jacket, when a light tap
at the window-pane drew his attention.</p>

<p class='c013'>A face was peeping at him through the window-pane,
a pale face surrounded with long hair. It
was the face of Con Cogan.</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy had during the last few days quite
forgotten Con and the housebreaking business;
but Con had not forgotten Patsy.</p>

<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c000' />
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch10' class='c009'>CHAPTER X <br /> <br /> THE GHOST CARRIAGE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>The boy stood staring at the apparition before
him, unable to speak, then he came towards
the window; Con was beckoning to him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is it?” said Patsy, speaking close up
to the window and in a low voice. “Go away
with you, or it’s ruined I’ll be.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Faith, it’s worse ruined you’ll be if you don’t
open the window,” replied Con’s voice, muffled
by its passage through the sash. “Open the
window, I want to talk to you. Where’s your
respect for your uncle, you spalpeen, to keep
him talkin’ to you through a closed window?
Up with the sash, and not another word out of
your head, or it’s I that will teach you your
manners with the end of me blackthorn stick.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy, trembling all over, undid the latch.
Con, as I have said before, had a great hold
over him—the hold that wicked people often
have over others. Patsy raised the sash, and
Con thrust his ugly head into the room.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who told you I was here?” said Patsy,
his teeth chattering, half from the effect of the
cold night wind that entered, making the candle
gutter in its socket, half from fear of his uncle.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who told me?” replied Con. “Why, who
else but Micky Finnegan.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I might a’ known the blackguard would
serve me that trick,” muttered Patsy. “Bad
cess’ to him and his goose, but I’ll be even with
him yet”!</p>

<p class='c013'>Con made no reply; having glanced round
the room, he was leaning now on the window-sill
with his arms crossed, and his eyes fixed on his
nephew with an amused and critical stare.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Will yiz look at the buttons on him?”
said he, as though he were addressing some
invisible third person; “and the stripes down
his legs like the side of a haddock?” Then
suddenly and ferociously: “Aren’t y’ ashamed
of yourself for disgracin’ your fam’ly?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Disgracin’ me which? Sure, what have I
been doin’?” asked Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Doin’! You ax me that question, and
you standin’ before me all over buttons and
stripes. Doin! Cleanin’ dishes and knives is
what you’ve been doin’, and you a Rooney,
and me a Cogan; going into sarvice, that’s
what you’ve been doin’——”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Cogan’s anger suddenly blazed forth, and
he made a stretch over the window-sill and
tried to land his nephew a “skelp” with the
famous blackthorn stick, and fortunately failed.</p>

<p class='c013'>His anger was not in the least simulated.
The Cogans and the Rooneys had always held
their heads very high, some of them as high
as the gibbet arm of Tullagh, but whatever
their history had been it showed no record of
menial service. Patsy’s father, by accepting
the post of gamekeeper at the Big House, had
lowered the family prestige somewhat; but he
was forgiven, for a gamekeeper, though he works
for his living as a servant, does not wear livery;
besides, he is a useful enough sort of relative,
when your own living is half gained by poaching.</p>

<p class='c013'>Con having failed to reach his nephew drew
back his stick, smothered his wrath, and resumed
his attitude, leaning with his arms crossed on
the window-ledge.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had come to fetch his nephew out of the
house for a purpose we will presently see; but
if you were to imagine Con doing anything he
set about in a straightforward and business-like
manner, you would be imagining the
impossible.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the old days, when he had the blacksmith’s
shop in Castle Knock, it would take him three
times as long to make a horse-shoe or shoe a
horse as it would take any other blacksmith in
the country.</p>

<p class='c013'>He would lean on his hammer and discourse
on the colour of the horse, on the state of the
weather, on anything at all so long as he could
hold you in talk, and stave off for a moment
doing the work he had before him. He was,
like most idle and useless people, as inquisitive
as a magpie.</p>

<p class='c013'>He leaned now on the window-ledge, looking
leisurely about him, whilst Patsy, who had skipped
into the furthest corner of the room, stood
looking at his uncle and shivering, and wishing
he would go.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s in them chest of drawers?” said
Con, nodding at the old deal chest of drawers
on which the candle was burning.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing,” replied Patsy; “only me ould
clothes and a shirt or two Mrs Kinsella has given
me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Open the drawer and take out your clothes,”
commanded his uncle.</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy did as he was bid.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now,” said the other, “off with them buttons
and stripes and on with the ould things, so that I
may forget I’m talkin’ to the disgrace of the
fam’ly.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy did as he was bid, and whilst he was
changing Con continued his conversation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I suppose,” said he, “there be great
preparings going on for the quality.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ay, is there,” replied Patsy, whose mind
was much perturbed by the thought of what
Con could be “afther,” for he well knew that
his uncle had come for some other purpose
than simply to stand at the window and talk
upon general subjects.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Pies and puddin’s and all,” went on Con.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And sham-pane,” added Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s that?” asked his uncle.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stuff in bottles wid gold tops to thim that
let’s off like a gun. The ould missis drinks it for
dinner every night in her life. Mr James give
me a glass of it from the lavin’s of the bottle,
and I’d no sooner drunk it than I tumbled down
the stairs wid a tray of glasses and smashed
every mother’s son of thim.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How many bottles does she drink of it?”
asked Con, whose estimation of Lady Seagrave
rose considerably at this graphic description
of her favourite beverage.</p>

<p class='c013'>“She doesn’t have more than a glass,” replied
Patsy; “and she mixes it with Siltzer water.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s water that tastes as if it was full of
pins and needles.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Con mused for a moment on the strange habits
of the high and mighty, whilst Patsy, who had
changed his clothes, stood waiting for what was
to follow. He had not long to wait.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come here,” said his uncle, “till I button
your coat for you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure, it is buttoned,” replied Patsy, who
was none too eager to come within reach.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come here, till I button it proper, or it’s
into the room I’ll be gettin’ to make your tylet
for you,” said Con, putting one leg over the
window-sill.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now Con was the biggest coward on earth,
and he had all sorts of strange ideas about the
law. He would help in a burglary as long as he
could do so safely; that is to say, he would urge
another man on and give advice, and help to
dispose of the plunder, but he was far too careful
of his skin to enter a house or take an active
part in the matter.</p>

<p class='c013'>Even now, though he put his leg over the sill
of the window, he would not have dared to enter
the room, for that would have been housebreaking;
but nothing could be done to a man for simply
standing at a window and “colloguing” with his
nephew. If Mrs Kinsella had appeared armed
with a broom he would have run like a scared
rabbit; but Patsy did not know this, Patsy took
his uncle on his face value, and certainly Con’s
face was of more value to him in affairs of this
sort than his heart, for his face was the face of
a formidable and villainous-looking rogue.
Scaring old women and children, sucking eggs,
stealing turnips, milking stray cows and trapping
rabbits, that was his way of life. Yet he had
the appearance of a brigand chief. There are
many people in the world like Con.</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy took a step towards his uncle; he seemed
fascinated, just as a mouse is fascinated by a cat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come on.” said Con, “before I put my other
leg over.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure, what do you want of me at all, at all?”
said the unfortunate Patsy, advancing against
his will; “what harm have I done you?—what
ails—ouch!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Con had suddenly seized him by the collar of
his jacket and dragged him through the window.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Speak a word, and you’re dead,” said his
uncle.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were in the midst of a clump of laurel
bushes that grew almost up to the window.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come on now,” whispered Patsy’s uncle,
dragging him along by the collar; “I’m not
goin’ to hurt a feather of you, but if you scream
it’s killed you’ll be. I’ve left the candle burnin’
on the chest o’ drawers, sure it’ll burn itself out.
Come on now, and tread gentle.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They took a path that led them round by the
side of the house to the terrace in front.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a starlight night, brilliant almost, as
if lit by the moon.</p>

<p class='c013'>Con led the way down the terrace steps, and
then, striking across the park, made for the beech
woods on the right.</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy followed him. They entered the long
drive that cut through the woods in the direction
of Castle Knock. They had gone scarcely a
quarter of a mile down it when a faint, flickering
glow amidst the trees on the right became visible,
and Patsy, clutching at his uncle’s coat-tail, hung
back.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had heard often enough that the witches
had a habit of meeting by night in the woods
here about. They would light a fire and make
soup in a big pot, and whilst it was boiling they
would all sit round and make jokes and tell
stories, and their laughter—so the tale went—was
enough to turn a man’s hair grey.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come on,” said Con; “what are you afeared
of?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s the witches,” said Patsy, in a terrified
voice. “Sure, Uncle Con, where’s your eyes
that you can’t see the light of their fire, and
they sittin’ round it biling babies in pots——”</p>

<p class='c013'>Con, without answering, seized his nephew
by the ear and dragged him along through the
trees in the direction of the light. The boy did
not mind the pain; it was almost a relief, for
it helped to drive the witches from his mind.</p>

<p class='c013'>A moment later they broke into a little clearing
in the midst of which a fire of holly sticks was
burning brightly. By the fire sat something as
bad, or maybe worse, than a company of witches.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was Paddy Murphy. He was sitting on
a bundle of dried ferns toasting his toes at the
burning logs, his old hat without a brim was
on the back of his head, and he held a big stick
in his hand with which every now and then he
gave the burning embers a prod.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So you’ve brought him,” said Paddy, looking
up as Con, leading his nephew by the ear, broke
out of the wood into the zone of firelight; “you’ve
cocht him alive-o. Faith, but it’s well he’s
looking; but what’s become of his buttons and
stripes?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Faith, he’s left them behind him,” said Con
making his nephew sit down on the ground, and
sitting down beside him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I can’t supply him with buttons,” said Mr
Murphy, “but I’ve a large supply of stripes,
and I’ll be after dealin’ them out to him right
handed if he so much as opens his mouth, or
stirs a finger, or does anythin’ but keep his ears
wide and listens to my directions. Are yiz
listenin’ to me, Patsy Rooney?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am,” said Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, keep on listenin’ and answer me
questions. First and foremost, when’s the quality
coming to the Big House?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Day after to-morrow,” replied Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How many is there?” went on Mr Murphy,
prodding the fire meditatively with his stick.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dozens of them. I heard Mrs Kinsella
sayin’ that a lot of thim was comin’ by spicial
train to Tullagh station.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Tullagh was the nearest railway station to
Glen Druid Park, and it was fifteen miles away.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Did you hear tell of anything else about
them?” asked Mr Murphy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I heard Mrs Kinsella say——” began Patsy,
then he stopped.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What did you hear her say?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ohone!” wailed Patsy, “sure, I oughtn’t
to be tellin’ you——”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Murphy drew a clasp-knife from his pocket,
opened it, tried the point on his thumb to see
if it were sharp, then, holding Patsy down with
one big hand on his chest, he approached the
point of the knife to his throat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t do it, Paddy!” cried Con, pretending
to be alarmed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve made up me mind,” said Mr Murphy,
“I’ve made up me mind to see the colour of
his blood, there’s no use in tryin’ to stop me.
I’ve made up me mind to see the colour of his
blood.”</p>

<p class='c013'>At this awful threat Patsy made sure that
his last moment had come. He was too frightened
to speak or cry out, he just lay staring at the
broad, red face of his executioner, or as much
as he could see of it, for Mr Murphy’s back was
half turned on the fire.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Tell him, Patsy,” implored Con, “or he’ll
have your life.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy felt the point of the knife tickling his
throat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s the jewels!” shrieked Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which jewels?” asked Mr Murphy. “Quick
now, or the knife goes into you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The jewels ould Lady Molyneux’s bringin’
with her worth hundredths of thousands of
pounds.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who told you of them?” went on Mr Murphy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mrs Kinsella, no less; she tould the maids
and I was listenin’. Ohone! sure, it’s ruined
I am!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Faith, you never said a truer word, if you
don’t tell all you know. Out with it all, before
I slits your wizzind.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dimonds and em’ralds and all,” cried Patsy.
“They say she do be wearin’ them wherever
she goes, and she ould enough to be Mrs Kinsella’s
mother.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where does she keep them at night?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“In a box on her dressin’ table. Mrs Kinsella
says she wonders the ould lady hasn’t been robbed
before this.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Faith, she won’t be wondering that long,”
said Mr Murphy, who now having got the information
he required, closed his knife and put it in
his pocket. “Have you been listenin’ to what
your nevy told me, Con Cogan?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have,” said Con.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now,” said Mr Murphy, turning to Patsy,
whom he had released, and who was sitting up
with his hair all towsled and a scared look on
his face—“now listen to me, for I’m goin’ to
talk bizness. Who locks the big front door at
night?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr James, the butler,” replied Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s he do with the key?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gives it to the ould missis—her ladyship,
I mean, and she puts it under her pilla’.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bad cess to her and her pilla’!” grumbled
Mr Murphy; “what makes her go mistrustin’
people like that for? Well, now, the windy’s
in front of the house: could you be afther openin’
the latch of one of them for me if I chanst to
call some night soon afther the family was in
bed to inspict the drains?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure, every windy in the front of the house
is fixed up with wires,” replied Patsy, “so that
if you raised one you’d ring a bell and a gun
would go off, and you’d be cocht as sure as sartin.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Think o’ that now,” said Mr Murphy. He
gazed into the fire without speaking whilst
Patsy ransacked his mind for more ideas. The
front door of Glen Druid was left at night, like
most other front doors, bolted and chained with
the key in the lock, any one could have opened it
from the inside; there were no wires on the front
windows except in Patsy’s imagination. Patsy
often made blunders in household duties, but he
was by no means a fool.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Think o’ that now,” said Mr Murphy, “the
suspicions of thim; faith, you might think there
were no honest men in the world at all, at all,
by the way some people go on. Now, how about
the little scullery window?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s been screwed up,” said Patsy, “wid
screws the length of your arm.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Paddy Murphy,” suddenly put in Con, who
had been listening to the foregoing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is it, Con Cogan?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s a fool you are.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Howsome, which way?” asked Mr Murphy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Can’t we get into the house the same way
I got Patsy out to-night?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And how was that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Through his bedroom window; it’s on the
floor be the ground, and there’s no locks or screws
to it, for he opened it to-night for me with a turn
of his wrist.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Faith, and that simplificates matters,” said
Mr Murphy. “And now I’ll draw up me plan
of campaign. Patsy Rooney!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Mr Murphy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You be all ears like an elephant whilst I tell
you what you’re to be doin’. First and foremost,
whin the company arrives you’re to spot the ould
lady who has the big jewels. What do you say
was her name?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lady Molyneux,” replied Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Having spotted her, you’re to find out where
she sleeps. Are yiz listenin’?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Mr Murphy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’re to lie awake every night till the clock
strikes twelve. One night in a day or two you’ll
hear a tap at your bedroom windy, you’ll open
the windy and I’ll come in; then you’ll go foreninst
me and lead me to the ould lady’s bedroom.
Don’t be thinking it’s her jewels I’m afther, I
am only wishful to read tracts to her and see
if she’s said her prayers. Now do you understand
clear what you’ve got to do?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Mr Murphy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Will yiz swear to do it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Mr Murphy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, then, repeat the form of the oath I’m
going to tell you; say it after me sintince by
sintince. Are yiz ready?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Mr Murphy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I, Patsy Rooney,” began the other, beating
time with his stick, whilst Patsy followed him
sentence by sentence, “bein’ in me sound mind
and body, hereby swears to do all Mr Murphy
bids me to do the uttermost farthin’ wid diligence
and despatch. And if I don’t, may me eyes
pop out of me head like burnin’ ches’nuts off a
hob; may me tongue hang down to me heels
and thrail in the dust and be dry ever after for
want of a drink, and may me hair turn grey as
a badger and fall off, leaving the head of me bald
as a coot. May me lift hand be turned into me
right hand, me feet twisted backwards, me legs
stuck where me arms be, and the nose of me
turned to the snout of a pig.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ohone!” wailed Patsy, when he had finished
this oath, “sure, it’s ruined I am entirely!”
The mental picture of the figure he would cut,
should he fail to carry out Mr Murphy’s biddings,
stood before his mind’s eye with horrible
distinctness.</p>

<p class='c013'>No other form of oath, perhaps, could have
had a more powerful effect on the half-savage
mind of the boy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s what you’ll be if you do a hair’s-breadth
beyond what I tell you,” said Mr Murphy.
“You’ve swore to it now, and you’ll have to
stick to it, or eat ever after out of a trough.
And now I’m goin’ to brand you and make a
freemason of you, so that you’ll know what’s
in store for you if you fails to keep your oath.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Murphy was not joking in the least; he
knew well the effect physical pain has in fixing
an impression on the mind. He pulled Patsy’s
sleeve up and was in the act of seizing a burning
stick from the fire when Con Cogan, who was
looking on and grinning, suddenly held up his
hand and said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whisht!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The little clearing in which they were seated
was quite close to the broad drive; one could see
between the tree-boles anything passing along
the drive, and something was coming now.</p>

<p class='c013'>I have said before that Glen Druid Park
was haunted, or reputed so to be. The apparition
took the form of a hearse driven by a man without
a head. He carried his head under his arm, so
the story ran, and, if the head caught sight of
any one, straight the driver would make for
him, bundle him into the vehicle, drive off with
him, and then he would never be seen again.</p>

<p class='c013'>Several people had seen this terrible thing.
Mrs Finnegan’s first husband had been coming
across the park one night when he had spied
the vehicle in the distance; it was travelling
in the opposite direction to that in which he
was going, but directly the driver sighted him
he had turned, whipped up the horses and started
in pursuit. Mr Finnegan ran. He arrived at
Castle Knock all covered with mud, and without
the bottle of whisky he had been carrying when
he started.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had thrown it away, so he said, and his
escape was put down to that fact, as no doubt
the driver of the ghostly vehicle had stopped
to pick it up. Some people objected that a
bottle of whisky could be of no use to a man
without a head, but they were overruled by
the fact that the bottle was found in the park
empty. That clinched the matter.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whisht!” said Con, raising his hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Murphy paused in his operations, and
Patsy, who had just been on the point of crying
out, held his breath and listened.</p>

<p class='c013'>Something was coming along the drive.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now the sound was more distinct, the foot-falls
of a horse and the creakings of a vehicle
of some sort could be made out. The thing
was coming along slowly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s the ‘carriage,’” said Con, whose white
face had become simply ghastly, “it’s the
‘hearse.’ I just caught a glimpse of the plumes
of it away beyant there between the trees; it’s
comin’ this way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lord save us!” said Mr Murphy, whose
crimson visage had become mottled with white.
“What’s that you’re saying, Con Cogan? Sure,
the ghost carriage wouldn’t be makin’ all that
nise.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wouldn’t it?” replied Con, whose teeth
were chattering. “Tim Finnegan, ’fore he died,
told me it rattled like a dunkey-cart when it
was chasin’ him, and the fellow that drove it
was peltin’ him all the time wid skulls an’ crossbones.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve heerd tell he has no power over childer;
and if one keeps one’s eyes tight shut, he don’t
see you as long as you don’t see him,” said Mr
Murphy, “so I’m goin’ to shut me eyes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“So’m I,” said Con.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Patsy, avick,” said Mr Murphy in a softened
tone, but without leaving hold of the boy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is it, Mr Murphy?” asked Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Keep your eyes wide open and tell us what
you see, for he has no power over childer, and
he can’t see thim, by the same token, for Father
O’Hara tould me so.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will, Mr Murphy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Now Patsy, who was half a savage, had a
savage’s acute sense of hearing, and, more than
that, of knowing what it was he heard. He
could tell the movements of a stoat from those
of a rabbit. He knew every cart and carriage
for miles round by the sound it made, and he
knew now quite well that the thing coming
along the drive was no ghost carriage, but Tim
Brady’s dung-cart, for the left wheel had a
squeak of its own that was quite unmistakable.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Brady’s business in life was to collect
manure and sell it, and as he had the habit of
stopping at public-houses and places on the
way home, he was often late in his peregrinations.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Are your eyes open, Patsy?” said Mr
Murphy, who still had a tight hold of the boy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They are,” said Patsy, pretending to chatter
his teeth; “but it’s tirrified I am, now I see it
through the trees. Musha! musha! it’s the
‘carriage’ sure enough, wid the great black
plumes of it wavin’, and the chap on the box
without a head on his shoulders.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ave Maria, ave Maria, ave Maria!” muttered
Mr Murphy, who was a devout Catholic when
he was frightened. “Con Cogan, y’ divil, be
sayin’ your prayers, or it’s a clip I’ll land you
with me stick. Ora pro nobis, save us an’
sanctify us—Patsy, what’s he afther now?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I see his head under his arm,” said Patsy,
“and the eyes of it glowin’ like the eyes of a
moth.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve robbed and I’ve stole,” mumbled Mr
Murphy. “I’ve treated me wife cruel, I ain’t
fit to be—what’s he afther now, Patsy?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Brady, seeing the glow of the fire amidst
the trees, had stopped his cart to inspect.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s stopped the carriage and he’s holdin’
his head up, and the eyes of it glowin’ like lamps.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Keep your eyes tight shut, Con,” said Mr
Murphy, “and confess your sins same as I’m
doin’. Ora pro nobis—I killed M’Carthy wid
a clip of a stick, though the crowner’s jury
brought it in appeplexy whin they found him
in the ditch wid the heels of him stickin’ in the
air, but I didn’t <i>mane</i> to do it; I only wanted
to rob him. Ora pro nobis—I shot old Mullins
in the small o’ the back so that the back buttons
of his coat was blown through his wistcoat, but
I didn’t <i>mane</i> to do it, for the gun wint off before
I could club him on the head with the butt of it.
Ora pro nobis, save us and sanctify us! Then
there’s the man I kilt at Tullagh fair, and I don’t
know his name at all, at all, for there was nothin’
in his purse to identify him by, only two pound
and a sheep-dip tablet which I ’et in mistake
for a cough drop and nearly burnt a hole in me
tongue—bad cess to him! Then there’s the
man—what’s he afther now, Patsy?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s after us!” yelled Patsy, springing to
his feet, and shaking himself free from Mr Murphy’s
clutch. “Run for your lives—here he comes!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Next moment Patsy, Mr Murphy and Con
were running through the woods, each in a different
direction. Patsy could hear the terrified shouts
of the others, and he stopped and held on to
the trunk of a small beech tree and laughed till
the tree shook.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then he resumed his way back to the Big
House at a “sweep’s trot” under the light of
the moon that was just rising over the distant
hills. His window was still open and the candle
had burnt itself out, but the moon gave light
enough to get into bed by. Still laughing and
chuckling to himself, he got between the sheets.</p>

<p class='c013'>Suddenly the laughing and the chuckling
ceased, for the remembrance of his oath came
back to him. He had sworn to open the window
for Paddy Murphy, and he well knew that,
though Paddy might be frightened enough to-night,
all the ghost carriages in the world would
not stop him from coming if he had made up his
mind to steal the jewels.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the knock came to the window he
would have to open it or go about for ever with
the snout of a pig, his legs where his arms were,
and his face where the back of his head ought
to be. It seems incredible that he should firmly
believe in such a happening, yet he did, for he
had the Celtic aptitude for belief, and his head
was filled with the most wonderful and wild
superstitions.</p>

<p class='c013'>He believed that the holy well at Tullagh
would cure warts if you placed your hand in
the water. He believed that holy water would
drive away devils, and he believed that old
Widow Finnegan could think a sick person well if
she set her mind to it. He believed in witches
and ghosts and banshees and cluricaunes. So
it is not, after all, to be wondered at that he
believed the oath he had solemnly taken would
“fly back on him” if he broke it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yet for all his youth and simplicity, Patsy
had a quickness of intelligence that many a
grown man might have envied. Though he
made mistakes at times, a week had converted
him into a fairly efficient page-boy; and he could
have held his own, with his tongue, against any
fish-woman on the quays of the Liffey.</p>

  <h2 id='ch11' class='c009'>CHAPTER XI <br /> <br /> THE FIRST GUEST</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“Doris,” said Lord Gawdor, breaking into
the schoolroom next afternoon, “Mr Fanshawe
is comin’ to-day!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t say ‘comin’,” replied Doris, looking
up from her book; “say ‘coming.’ It’s only
the Johnny-jumped-ups that clip their words;
I heard Uncle Molyneux saying so.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who are they?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, brewers and shipowners and people,” said
Doris with fine contempt. “Who’s Mr Fanshawe?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I dunno. I heard Mrs Kinsella say he was
a cousin of father’s, and I heard Mary, the between-maid,
telling Biddy Mahony he was coming to-day.
He’s coming for Christmas, and he’s bringing
a lot of horses. Rest of the people are coming
to-morrow, but Mr Fanshawe’s been staying
with some people hunting forty miles away,
and he’s going to drive over.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wonder what he’ll be like? I say, isn’t
it rubbish us being stuck up here like this!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let’s send a round-robin to granny to ask
her to let’s come down,” suggested Lord Gawdor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You don’t know granny!” replied Doris,
subsiding into the book she was reading.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were still prisoners confined to the upper
part of the house, and they would have to remain
prisoners till the next morning, for their grandmother
was an old lady who never went back on
her word.</p>

<p class='c013'>At this moment a knock came to the door,
and Patsy entered with a coal-scuttle full of coal.</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy, as a rule was a bright-looking boy,
enough, but this afternoon his face was very
lugubrious and his hair looked tousled. It was
always like that when anything, to use his own
expression, “addled” him; no brushing would
keep it down, it stuck out in all directions.
Patsy’s hair was a sort of weather-glass from
which you could tell the state of his mind;
when angry or fighting it seemed to bristle just
as the back of a wire-haired terrier bristles;
when he was “addled” it stuck out “every
which way” as Mrs Kinsella once said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hullo, Patsy!” cried Lord Gawdor.
“What’s the matter with you? Why don’t
you go and brush your hair?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bob!” said Doris, “don’t be personal.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Patsy don’t matter,” replied Lord Gawdor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure, Mrs Kinsella has been brushin’ at it
for an hour, Misther Robert,” said Patsy, putting
his coal box down. “‘What ails you?’ says
she, ‘for it’s more like a broom than a page-boy
you are this mornin’,’ says she. ‘Sure, it’s
addled I am,’ says I.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What has addled you, Patsy?” asked Doris.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dhrames, Miss Doris.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What were the dreams, Patsy?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I dhreamt I let robbers into the house through
the bedroom windy,” replied Patsy in a faltering
voice. “Miss Doris, what would they be afther
doin’ to me if I did a thing like that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They would hang you, Patsy,” replied Doris
in a cheerful voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ohone!” cried the unfortunate Patsy, as if
he were addressing some third person, “listen to
that?—sure, it’s hanged I’d be. Miss Doris!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Patsy?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If I was goin’ about wid me legs where me
arums ought to be, and me face twisted back
to front, and me nose turned into a pig’s snout—for
I dhreamt I was like that in me dhrame—what
would I do for a livin’ at all, at all?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t know,” said Doris, trying to conjure
up an occupation for a person so peculiarly
situated and failing. “But you aren’t going to
be like that, so don’t think about it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Miss Doris,” said Patsy, who listened to
this advice without relaxing in the least the
lugubrious expression on his face, “whin’s the
ould lady all covered wid jewels comin’?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which old lady? What on earth do you
mean, Patsy?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ould Lady Molyneux,” replied Patsy; “I’ve
heard tell she’s all stuck over wid jewels like
the plums on a puddin’!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She’s coming to-morrow, I believe,” said
Doris. “And you are not to speak in that
disrespectful way of a lady!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m not wishin’ to be disrespectful, Miss
Doris; but I dhreamt last night Paddy Murphy
had broke into the house.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who is he?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A highwayman, Miss Doris; and he had
the ould lady on the floor and was prizin’ the
jewels off her wid the point of his knife same
as you prize barnacles off a rock down by the
say-side.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Gawdor gave a howl of laughter. He
was not in love with his Aunt Molyneux, and
the picture of her as imagined by Patsy tickled
his fancy immensely.</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy, seeing him laugh, grinned in a half-hearted
fashion and scratched his head.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Miss Doris,” said he, looking up from the
toes of his boots which he had been contemplating
and still grinning, not from merriment, but as if
the grin had stuck to his face and would not come
off, “couldn’t you tell the ould lady to keep away,
for it’s afear’d I am that the dhrame will come
true.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wish I could,” said Doris whole-heartedly;
then, remembering to whom she was speaking:
“Don’t talk nonsense. It’s very wicked to be
superstitious and believe in dreams—besides,
dreams always come contrary; if you dream
of a wedding some one is sure to die, and if
you dream a person is dead, it’s a sign they are
going to be married——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I say,” said Lord Gawdor, who had climbed
on to the window-seat, “come here.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Doris came to the window. An outside car
piled with luggage was coming across the park
along the drive. On one side of the car sat the
driver, on the other a young gentleman in a
Norfolk jacket and a shooting cap; he had a pipe
in his mouth.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was the first of the expected guests.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s Mr Fanshawe,” said Doris. “Isn’t
he nice-looking!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look, there’s two gun-cases,” said Lord
Gawdor. “My eye! wonder where his horses
are?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He couldn’t bring his horses on the car with
him,” said Doris.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who said he could, stupid?” replied his
lordship, pushing the window up.</p>

  <h2 id='ch12' class='c009'>CHAPTER XII <br /> <br /> MR FANSHAWE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Dicky Fanshawe, as every one called him,
was twenty-five years of age. He had enough
money to do what he liked, and so, as a rule,
he did nothing; at least, that was what his
uncle, General Grampound, said about him.
But as a matter of fact, he did a great deal, for
wherever he went he made people feel happier
and better.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was not what people call a “good young
man.” He spent a great deal of money in ways
that people said he shouldn’t, but he also spent
a great deal of money in a way that nobody
knew anything about, for he was always ready
to help a person in distress. He was a dead
shot, a great cricketer, and he nearly always was
in the first flight in the hunting field.</p>

<p class='c013'>General Grampound, Dicky’s uncle, was very
strict; ever since Dicky had been a boy General
Grampound had found fault with him. Six
months ago they had had a really fierce quarrel;
it had begun over some trifle, hot words had
ensued, and it ended by the General telling his
nephew never to darken his doors again.</p>

<p class='c013'>This command would not have broken Dicky’s
heart, indeed he would have cared very little
about it, only that he was in love with General
Grampound’s ward, a dark-haired, beautiful
girl named Violet Lestrange.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had not seen her for six months, and as
General Grampound intercepted all his letters
to her, he could not write to her.</p>

<p class='c013'>To-day he had left Dunboyne House, where
he had been staying for the hunting, at ten
o’clock, and it was nearly four when the outside car
turned in through the lodge gates of Glen Druid.</p>

<p class='c013'>As the car drew up towards the house front,
Mr Fanshawe heard himself hailed. The voice
seemed to come from the sky, and, looking up,
he saw two heads projecting from a window
in the grey old side of the house, the head of a
girl with golden hair and the head of a rather
pasty-faced little boy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hulloo!” cried the heads; and an arm,
presumably that of the boy, waved something
by way of a flag, something that seemed either
a huge and dirty pocket-handkerchief or an old
dish-cloth.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hulloo!” replied Mr Fanshawe, waving
his pipe.</p>

<p class='c013'>Next moment a small potato, which Lord
Gawdor had been playing desert islands<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c019'><sup>[1]</sup></a> with,
caught Mr Fanshawe on the shoulder, and, rebounding,
hit the car driver on the nose.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bad cess to them childer!” said the driver.
“They’re the divil and all; never aisy but whin
they’re aslape, I’ve heard tell.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They’re all there, aren’t they?” said Mr
Fanshawe, as the car drew up at the steps.
“Might have been worse if they’d fired turnips
on us. Cousin Robert’s kids, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He jumped off the car and went up the steps,
where old James, the butler, was waiting to
receive him.</p>
<div class='footnote c020' id='f1'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. A chalk ring on the nursery floor makes the island.</p>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Lady Seagrave was a great friend of General
Grampound’s, but she had not seen Dicky Fanshawe
since he was a boy at school.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Her ladyship is waiting to receive you in the
blue boudoir, sir,” said old James; “but O
Mr Fanshawe”—he looked with horror at the
pipe which Dicky had laid on the hall table—“O
Mr Fanshawe, her ladyship can’t a-bear pipes!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Never mind,” replied Dicky, lightly, hanging
up his hat; “she can smoke cigars, if she prefers
them.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I haven’t seen you for twelve years, Mr
Fanshawe,” said the old man. “Last time I
seen you was when you were a boy from school;
how you have grown, to be sure! But it ain’t
a question of cigars—her ladyship has a horror
of all tobacco; and when gentlemen are here
as are addicted to smokin’ they has to smoke
in the scrubbery.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where on earth’s that?” asked Dicky.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Under the trees at the side o’ the house, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, the shrubbery you mean. All right—yes,
I remember you well, James. Twelve
years ago—why, it seems a thousand years ago
since I paid that visit to Wapshot Park with the
General—you were butler then too. Do you
remember the day I tumbled out of the apple
tree into the horse pond, and came home without
any shoes and all covered with mud?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That I do, sir,” said James, grinning at the
recollection; “and the face the General pulled
when he saw you. This way, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lady Seagrave was seated by the fire in the
boudoir just as we saw her on the day Patsy
Rooney made her acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How you have grown!” said the old lady,
when she had shaken hands with her visitor
and motioned him to a seat on the opposite
side of the fireplace. “The last time I saw
you, you were in knickerbockers and a turned-down
collar. I hope you have grown in wisdom
as well as in stature. You will find the house
rather dull to-day, I’m afraid, but it will be
more lively to-morrow, for I am expecting a
house-party of quite interesting people.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I saw some jolly-looking kids at one of the
windows upstairs,” said Mr Fanshawe. “Cousin
Robert’s, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Kids!” cried the old lady, raising her ear-trumpet.
“I have an abhorrence of goats;
how did they get into the house?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I didn’t mean goats’ kids, I meant children.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Umph!” replied Lady Seagrave. “May I
beg you to say in future what you mean? It
abbreviates conversation, and places the matter
under discussion in a more clear light.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am awfully sorry,” said Dicky; “but”—speaking
very loudly and distinctly—“I saw
some nice-looking children looking out of a window
upstairs; I suppose they are Cousin Robert’s
kids—I beg your pardon—I mean children.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am not deaf,” replied the old lady testily,
“but I can’t hear a word when people shout at
me. I use this trumpet because I am subject
to <i>tinnitus aurium</i>. Now repeat your remark in
an ordinary conversational tone, enunciate your
syllables, and don’t shuffle your feet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I saw some nice-looking kids—I beg your
pardon—I mean I saw some——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There is nothing to beg my pardon about,”
cut in Lady Seagrave. “Well, go on; what
were you going to say—you saw some kids.
Where did you see them, and what about them?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I saw them on the road,” said Dicky
desperately, for he felt quite beyond trying to
explain his real meaning.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s right,” said Lady Seagrave in a soothed
voice. “Speak at that pitch and I will be able
to hear you. You saw these creatures on the
road—well, what were they doing?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t know,” replied Mr Fanshawe meekly;
“they were—being driven by a man.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, but what about them?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I mean exactly what I say—what about
them?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing, I only mentioned the fact.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I see, just to make conversation. The art
of conversation is lost, it seems to me; when
I think of the sparkle and wit of the conversation
of the young men of my day, and contrast it
with the conversation of the young men of to-day,
I am lost in wonder at what has happened to their
brains. Your remark would be interesting if
I were a goat fancier, which I am not. But you
were never very bright, Richard Fanshawe, even
as a boy; I remember that.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thanks,” said Dicky, rather huffled, yet
still amused at the outspoken old lady, who,
when she took a pen in her hand to write an
invitation, was most courtly and kind in her
manner of expression (<i>vide</i> her note in first
chapter of this book), but whose tongue in
conversation was direct.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All the brains in your family,” went on Lady
Seagrave, “seems to have been absorbed by
your uncle, General Grampound. You will see
him to-morrow——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good gracious!” said Dicky, “is uncle
coming here?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, he is coming as one of my guests.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is—Is—Miss Lestrange coming with him?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She is.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh!” said Dick in a delighted voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I beg your pardon—what did you say?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I only said Oh!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh what?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing—I meant nothing.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You could not have meant less. Yes, Miss
Lestrange is coming; and Mr Boxall, the Member
of Parliament, who is greatly enamoured of
Miss Lestrange, is coming too. He is worth
seven thousand a year, and I believe, if I have
any eyes in my old head, she returns his passion.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Fanshawe groaned.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How old is he?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr Boxall.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He is only fifty-five,” replied Lady Seagrave;
“though the fact of premature baldness adds
perhaps to his apparent age. But Violet Lestrange
is not frivolous-minded, she can appreciate true
worth; and,” finished the old lady grimly,
“she has got to marry him, for I have set my
heart on the match.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I suppose you know that I have had a fight
with my uncle,” said Dicky in a cheerful voice,
for the description of Mr Boxall’s personal
appearance had raised his spirits wonderfully.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” replied Lady Seagrave, “and that is
why I asked you here. I want you to make up
with him and be friends. Now, like a good
boy, go and brush your hair and make yourself
tidy. You can amuse yourself in the library
with books till dinner-time; I feel sleepy, and
want to take my afternoon nap.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The old lady seemed still to imagine Dicky
Fanshawe the schoolboy he was twelve years
ago, and he, nothing loth, rose and made for the
door. In the hall outside he found Patsy Rooney.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr James told me to ax you for the keys of
your trunks, sir,” said Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, he did, did he? Well, as I’m going
to my room I’ll open my trunks, as you call them,
myself. Go on before me and show me the way.
What’s your name?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Patsy Rooney is me name,” replied the
other, leading the way upstairs, “but they
calls me Patsy for short. I clanes the boots
and the windys, and looks afther the childer
since the governess was took sick and wint off
to the infirmary wid the maisles.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What on earth is the maisles?” asked
Mr Fanshawe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s what the pigs get,” replied Patsy, leading
the way down the corridor, “whin they come
out all over spots.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, the measles, you mean?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s thim,” said Patsy, pausing at a door
and opening it. “This is your room, Misther
Fanshawe; and there’s hot wather in that big
blew jug forninst you on the wash-stand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You just wait and help me to unpack,”
said Dicky. “My man sprained his foot, and
I had to leave him behind. Here, lug that
portmanteau out from the wall, till I open it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy did as he was bidden, and then stood
by watching the proceedings.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr Fanshawe, sir,” said Patsy, after a
moment’s silence, “is there guns in thim boxes?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which boxes?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thim flat ones by the windy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes; those are gun-cases.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr James said they were; but, sure, they
must be mighty small guns to be put in little
boxes like thim. Me father’s the gamekeeper,
but wan of his guns is twiced the length of wan
of thim boxes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I daresay; but these are breech-loaders,
and take to pieces. How does your father load
his guns, Patsy?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He rams the stuff down the muzzle wid a
ramrod. And by the same token, there’s a
parcel of ca’tridges for you, sir, I brought over
from Castle Knock a week ago. They’re in
the kitchen, I b’leve.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I ordered them to be sent on here.
Put these shirts in that drawer.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr Fanshawe, sir,” said Patsy, as he put
the shirts in the drawer, “would yiz like to have
a shot at a burglar?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I shouldn’t mind,” replied Mr Fanshawe.
“Stick this coat on the chair over there. What
has put burglars in your mind?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I dunno,” replied Patsy, grinning and scratching
his head; “but I dhrimt there was burglars
in the house last night, and, thinks I to meself
just now, if you was to stick a ca’tridge in wan
of thim guns you might have fine sport some
night soon, and Paddy Murphy’s back buttons
might be blown through his wistcoat same as he
blew old Mullins’.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What on earth are you talking about?”
asked Mr Fanshawe. “Who is Paddy Murphy—here,
stick those trousers on the chair with
the coat—and who is old Mullins?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I dunno,” replied Patsy, placing the trousers
on the coat; “it’s me dhrames that do be addlin’
me. But if me dhrames come true it’s fine
shootin’ you’ll be havin’ some night wid all thim
guns, and it’s I that’ll be givin’ you the word
whin to be loadin’ thim.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Here, get along!” said Mr Fanshawe, opening
a hunting kit-bag. “Put these shirts in that
top drawer, and don’t be talking nonsense;
put these waistcoats in with the shirts.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The hounds meet to-morra at Castle Knock.
I s’pose you’ll be afther followin’ thim, sir,”
said Patsy, as he placed the waistcoats in the
drawer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will,” replied Mr Fanshawe. “What time’s
the meet?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nine o’clock, sir; and there’s a big baste of
a fox in the Galtee woods where they’re goin’
to draw, wid a white tip to his tail, as ’ill go
like clock-work, for I set me eyes on him on’y
a wake ago whin I was settin’ snares the day
before they stuck me in buttons and made a
page-boy of me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How do you like being page-boy?” asked
Mr Fanshawe, who was working at the unpacking
of his things in his shirt sleeves and, despite
James’s warning, with a cigarette in his mouth.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Faith,” said Patsy, “if it wasn’t for the
childer it’s back to the woods I’d be to-morrow,
for it’s nothing but ‘Patsy’ here and ‘Patsy’
there, and ‘Patsy, ye divil, what are you standin’
idle for?’ if I stops to rest me bones for the
quather of a minit. Sure, it’s twelve pair of
hands on the ends of me arms I’d want to plaze
Mrs Kinsella; but as for the childer, faith, anything
plazes thim.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“So you’re acting as nursery governess as
well as page-boy,” said Mr Fanshawe, who was
beginning to perceive that Patsy was a person
of an original disposition, and not at all a page-boy
of the ordinary type.</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy grinned.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They’re in prizen,” said he.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who are in prison?” asked Mr Fanshawe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The childer.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, what are you talking about? I saw
them looking out of a top window.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Faith, and they’re in prizen all the same,”
said Patsy. “That was the windy Mr Robert
kicked the futball through; and between that
and Miss Doris hittin’ me a belt on the nose wid
an arringe, the ould lady gave orders they wasn’t
to stir out of the top of the house till to-morrow
mornin’.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Fanshawe, remembering the potato that had
hit him on the shoulder, began to form ideas of
his own about the children of his cousin Robert.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They must find it rather dull,” he said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not they,” replied Patsy. “They always
find something to be afther; on’y half an hour
ago when I lift them they were settin’ the dolls’
house afire wid a tin of paraffin.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good Heavens! You don’t mean to say
you let them!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, they’re all right,” said Patsy. “Sure,
they had it on the hearthstone.”</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c013'>That evening, just before bedtime, the schoolroom
door opened and Patsy’s head appeared.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr Fanshawe’s give me half a crown,”
said he. “And he’s got lave for the both of
yiz to go to the meet to-morra mornin’ in the
cart. I’m to drive you.” He put the half-crown
in his eye like an eye-glass, drew the corners
of his mouth almost up to his eyes by some
extraordinary muscular action known to himself
alone, protruded his tongue, waggled it from
side to side and vanished, just in time to escape
a Principia Latina aimed at him by Lord Gawdor.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch13' class='c009'>CHAPTER XIII <br /> <br /> THE MEET OF THE HOUNDS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>The next morning was dull and grey, with not a
trace of frost—an ideal hunting morning.</p>

<p class='c013'>The meet was fixed for nine o’clock at the
cross-roads, by the village of Castle Knock;
and at eight you might have seen Bob Mahony,
the sweep, clattering down the main street of
Castle Knock in his donkey-cart, his face washed
and shining, so that you would never have
known he was a sweep, only for the traces of
soot round the back of his ears and the nape of
his neck that the towel had failed to reach.</p>

<p class='c013'>He always turned out for a meet of the hounds.
His donkey was a tiny mouse-coloured beast, the
quickest and the wickedest donkey in the county.
“Game as a tarrier,” to use Bob’s expression,
“and not to hold or bind when she hears the
hounds giving lip.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He drew up at the sign-post that is set at the
cross-roads, and he had scarcely got down to
put the nose-bag on the donkey, to keep her
“aisy,” when over the fields, from the direction of
Tullagh, taking the low stone walls in his strides,
came Billy the Buck.</p>

<p class='c013'>A meet of the hounds without Billy the Buck
would have been a function robbed of most of
its picturesqueness and colour.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was a dark gipsy-looking personage, in
an old red waistcoat with tarnished brass buttons;
he lived in hayricks and such places, caught
rats, sold rabbit skins, trapped moles, did a bit
of petty thieving when times were bad, and a bit
of poaching whenever he could get the chance.
He followed the hounds on foot, and was always
in at the death, for he could run like a hare and
jump like a horse. He was “near seven fut”—that
is to say, he measured six feet six, and,
to use the local expression, he was as “thin as a
barber’s pole.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The top of the marnin’ to you!” cried Billy,
vaulting over the low stone wall separating the
road from the fields.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, it’s yourself, is it?” said the sweep.
“And what’s the news?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s an ould grey dog-fox in Rafferty’s
Clump,” cried Billy. “He’s the wan that took
earth at Kilgobbin last year, whin Mr Moriarty
broke his back over the sunk fence beyant Highberries
Barn; I knowed him by the ring on his
tail and the thrap mark on his lift shoulder, where
the hair’s grown a different colour. ‘Good-marnin,’ says I, whin I see him ten minits ago.
‘It’s you that’ll be sweepin’ the country-side
with your brush before you’re an hour older,
or me names not Billy the Buck,’ I says. And
with that he livels it at me like a gun, and into
the bushes he pops, with his eye over his shoulder
at me. Who’s this comin’ on the big brown
horse?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“One of the quality from the Big House,”
replied the sweep, as Mr Fanshawe, in spotless
pink and mounted on a superb hunter, turned
the corner of the road from Glen Druid.</p>

<p class='c013'>After Mr Fanshawe, and some way behind,
came the governess-cart driven by Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now along all the four roads horsemen could
be seen converging towards Castle Knock cross.
All sorts of nags, good, bad, and indifferent,
ridden by all sorts of people, small farmers,
sporting squireens from Tullagh, a sprinkling of
gentry, so that in five minutes the space of the
cross-roads presented a lively enough picture;
and you could scarcely hear yourself speak, for
every one seemed to know every one else, and
the shouting and the laughing was enough to
have raised the old malefactors who for centuries
had been buried at the cross-roads with stakes
through their middles.</p>

<p class='c013'>Suddenly the talking and the laughing ceased,
for away down the road leading to Kilgobbin might
be seen the hounds coming along like a moving
furze bush and the pink-clad figures of the
master and the two whips.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Here they come!” cried Patsy, who had
been endeavouring to keep the hog-maned pony
from the vicious attentions of the sweep’s donkey.
“Misther Mahony, will yiz keep your dunkey
to yourself, for he’s tryin’ to bite the pony’s nose
off. Miss Doris, sit back a bit and trim the cart,
for it’s kickin’ us in flinders he’ll be if the shoulderstrap
presses too hard on him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy was well able to drive; for the matter
of that, he could sit a horse bare-backed that
many a good horseman could not sit saddled.
It was the proudest moment of his life to be
driving Lord Gawdor and Miss Doris (Selina
was not of the party, having developed a snuffling
cold during the night); and his satisfaction was
not decreased by the fact that Widow Finnegan’s
son was present.</p>

<p class='c013'>The latter was leaning against the sign-post,
and every now and then his evil eye would fall
upon the governess-cart and Patsy, and he would
address some remark to the two boys he was
talking to, boys as ill-looking as himself, and
then the three would burst into a guffaw of
laughter.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’ll be a bad year this for the crops, Mr
Rafferty,” cried Patsy, addressing a stout farmer
on a skew-bald nag a few yards away, and speaking
in such a loud voice that every one could hear
him, Micky Finnegan included.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And how’s that, Patsy?” asked the farmer,
touching his hat to Lord Gawdor and Doris.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All the scarecrows have struck bisiness,”
said Patsy, nodding towards Micky and his
followers. “Not that it matters much, for the
crows had ceased to be afeared of them.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dustpans and brums!” yelled Micky to an
acquaintance across the road. “Mr Moriarty,
will you lend me a dustpan and brum?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Faith,” said Patsy, still addressing Mr
Rafferty, “it’s the first time in me life I’ve ever
heard rubbish cryin’ out for a broom. Sure,
it’s late in the day he is, for he ought to have
been swep’ up long ago.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Patsy,” said Mr Fanshawe, ranging up
beside the governess-cart, “what are you doing?
Remember who you are driving.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t stop him, Mr Fanshawe,” said little
Lord Gawdor; “he’s always giving that long
boy no end beans—cheeky beast!”</p>

<p class='c013'>All further discussion was cut short by the
arrival of the hounds, and the master, Mr O’Farrell
of Tuffnell Park.</p>

<p class='c013'>The whips consulted for a moment with the
master, and then the second whip conferred
with Billy the Buck. The result of this conference
was that the master resolved to draw Rafferty’s
Clump, where the old grey dog-fox with the
ring on his tail was supposed to be.</p>

<p class='c013'>Rafferty’s Clump is a huge spinny; it forms
part of the Galtee woods. There are not many
trees in the Galtee woods; it is a great space of
barren country, with here and there an isolated
copse. The horsemen moved off down the road,
following the master and the hounds, and the
governess-cart and donkey-cart followed in the
crush.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mind your manners!” cried Patsy, as the
sweep’s donkey-cart jostled the “tub,” as the
governess-cart was sometimes called. “There’s
no hurry; they won’t be needin’ you yet awhile
to frighten the fox out of the wood.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dunkeys is particular fond of carrots,”
replied Mr Mahony, making veiled reference to
Patsy’s unfortunate head.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Faith, then,” said Patsy, “if I’d known
that, I’d have brought some in me pocket for
the pair of yiz.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The procession paused whilst a gate was opened,
and then the whole field streamed over a stretch of
broken country, in the direction of Rafferty’s
Clump.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Billy,” cried Patsy to Billy the Buck, who
was trotting beside the “tub,” touching his
hat now and then whenever he caught
Lord Gawdor’s eye, “is there a fox in the
clump?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ould dog-fox, grey as a badger,” replied
Billy, “thrap-marked on the shoulder, wid a
ring to his tail.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“White ring?” asked Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Crame-white.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know him as well as me own brother,”
said Patsy. “Mr Fanshawe, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is it?” asked Mr Fanshawe, who
was riding close to them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s the ould fox that broke Mr Moriarty’s
back. If he breaks to the aist he’ll be off to
Kilgobbin, and mind the sunk fence beyant
Highberries Barn; if he breaks to the west the
divil won’t stop him till he gets to the big stone
wall beyant the river. He’ll have to strike up
it half a mile to get to the hole in it, and thin
he’ll strike across the twinty acres, sure, for it’s
the earths in the Tullagh woods he’ll be makin’
for; so I’ll give yiz the word, and if you hear
me shout ‘Tullagh,’ send your man wid your
second horse to the Tullagh cross-roads to meet
you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You seem to know the lie of the country,
Patsy,” said Mr. Fanshawe, who had drawn
rein, and was sitting listening to the querulous
yapping of the dogs busy in the wood.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve follied the hounds ever since I was the
height of me knee,” replied Patsy. Then:
“Hurroo! hurroo! he’s broke away to the west.
‘Tullagh’ whoop. Hould tight, Miss Doris,
and we’ll follow thim to the rise.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The fox had broken away to the west, going,
to use Patsy’s expression, like a railway train.</p>

<p class='c013'>Doris had need to follow Patsy’s advice and
“hould tight,” for the “tub” was racing the
donkey-cart for the rise, an elevation from which
the whole sweep of the country round could be
viewed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There they go!” cried Patsy, as Punch,
the pony, drew up puffing and blowing and all
of a lather. “Look, Mr Robert! Sure, it
makes me ache in the legs to see them and not
to be wid them.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The field had spread out like a fan. One horse
having stepped in a rabbit hole and flung its
rider, was following the chase at its own sweet
will with bridle streaming and empty saddle.</p>

<p class='c013'>Away from the ruck and leading by a good
distance, one could see the master, the whips
and Mr Fanshawe; behind these, but not so
far behind, a thing like an animated flail; this
was Billy the Buck, who, not being afraid of
rabbit’s holes, and knowing the boggy bits and
other pitfalls, managed to hold his own, and
would manage so to do till the end of the day.
After him came the other mounted folk, and
after them, at the heel of the hunt, all sorts of
running ragamuffins.</p>

<p class='c013'>The “tub” and Mr. Mahony’s donkey-cart
being the only wheeled vehicles, were alone in
their glory on the rise.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Mahony was standing up in his cart making
audible comments on the run, a sooty pipe an
inch long in his mouth.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s doubled!” suddenly yelled Patsy.
“He’s afear’d of the river; it’s Killbegg he’ll
be making for, and we’ll cotch a sight of them
on the road if we can get there in time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll race yiz to the gate,” cried Mr Mahony,
sitting down plump in his cart and plucking
up the head of his donkey whilst he hit it a
whack with the blackthorn stick he carried for
a whip. “A hundred to one I get there
first, and the divil take the hindmost.
Hurroo!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hurroo!” yelled Patsy. “Go it, Punch!
Hould tight, Miss Doris—don’t be afear’d—we’ll
be all right if the wheels hold and he doesn’t
stick his fut in a rabbit hole. Hi! hi! hi!
Sut-bags! drive fair, and don’t be crowdin’
me—we’re over—we ain’t—Holy Mary! the
springs are goin’—hould on by your teeth, we’re
comin’ to a trinch!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Now, along the Tullagh road at this minute
was coming a waggonette containing the first
contingent of the guests from England, arrived
only an hour ago at Tullagh station, and on their
way to Glen Druid.</p>

<p class='c013'>There were four people in the waggonette.
General Grampound, an old gentleman, with
a white moustache and a red face, sat in one
corner. One could tell at a glance what he
was; Nature and his profession had labelled
him plainly: “Old East Indian general—peppery—this
side up—don’t touch.”</p>

<p class='c013'>By General Grampound sat his ward, Violet
Lestrange, a pretty girl, with dark hair and
blue eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>Opposite General Grampound sat Uncle Molyneux,
a very aristocratic-looking, middle-aged
person who wore an eye-glass and a waxed
moustache.</p>

<p class='c013'>Opposite Violet Lestrange sat Mr Boxall,
the Member of Parliament, who looked as if
he had swallowed a Blue Book and had not
finished digesting it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Boxall had a large white face, but the
most peculiar thing about him was his eyes.
The pupil of his left eye was about twice the size
of the pupil of the right eye. It had also a
cold and steadfast stare, for it was made of glass.
This glass eye of Mr Boxall’s was what is called
an open secret; every one knew of it, but no one
mentioned it openly. On account of it, old
ladies, when they spoke of him, called him “poor
Mr Boxall.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The stone wall of the road was so low that
the race between the donkey-cart and the “tub”
could be clearly seen by the people in the
waggonette.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, God bless my soul!” said Uncle
Molyneux, screwing his eye-glass tight in his
eye and half standing up so as to get a better
view, “I believe it is my nephew and niece.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They’ll be over!” cried Violet Lestrange,
who was also half standing up. “Look! look!
the pony is running away.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who’s that ruffian in the donkey-cart?”
cried General Grampound. “They are racing
him—the pony has not run away; I see the
boy beating it with the whip. Hi, you, sir!
you in the donkey-cart—I’ll give you in charge
of the police.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s little he cares about the police,” said
the driver of the waggonette, who was also
following the race with interested eyes. “That’s
Bob Mahony, the chimbly sweep, and he’s been
to the meet of the houn’s, for his face is washed.
Look! he’s gainin’ on the pony carridge—Ten
to one on the dunkey!—ten to one on the dunkey!
Lather her, Bob, lather her! They’re makin’
who’ll get through the gate first. He’ll do it!
He won’t! He will, be jabers—Hurroo!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The donkey-cart having outstripped the “tub,”
was passing through the gate triumphant and
victorious, when the right wheel caught the post
and over it went, sweep, cart, donkey and all.</p>

<p class='c013'>The driver of the waggonette drew the vehicle
up and got down, heedless of General Grampound
or anything else, and approached the wreckage
on the road.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Are yiz kilt, Bob Mahony?” asked the driver,
bending down with his hands on his knees and
staring at the prostrate figure in the road.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Faith, I dunno yet,” said the figure, sitting
up and putting one hand to the top of its head.
“Me head’s on, but I seems to have left me
intellicts in the field beyant.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Feel your legs to see if they’re bruck,”
commanded the driver.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Legs is all right,” replied Mr Mahony, feeling
them contemplatively; “back’s all right, and
arums. I’ll be on me pins again in a minit
when the wheels has done spinnin’ in me head.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Right y’are,” replied the other. “I’ll be
after getting the dunkey on her feet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>General Grampound, furious with anger at
being stopped, had been aiming himself like
a gun now at Mr Mahony, now at the driver,
now at the donkey lying on its side on the road,
but he had withheld his fire. Patsy’s red head
(he had lost his cap) as the “tub” made its
appearance in the gateway, served as a target,
however, and he let fly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hi, you, boy,” cried General Grampound,
“you, boy, with the red head—how dare you
disgrace your livery, sir, racing sweeps in donkey-carts
and blocking my road!”</p>

<p class='c013'>One might have fancied that the road, the stone
walls, the earth and the sky were the property
of General Grampound. As a matter of fact,
he had less to do with the matter than Uncle
Molyneux; but Uncle Molyneux was a placid,
and easygoing person, who if the sky had fallen
would not have been much put out, as long as
the pieces did not hit him, and he was quite content
to sit still, observe matters through his eye-glass,
and let General Grampound do the shouting.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, it’s Uncle Molyneux!” cried Lord
Gawdor, as Patsy engineered the “tub” through
the gate, avoiding the donkey and cart, which
were now on their respective legs and wheels.</p>

<p class='c013'>Uncle Molyneux nodded; but before he could
speak, Miss Lestrange, who had got out of the
waggonette, approached the “tub.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How you have grown, Doris! and you too,
Bob. Don’t you remember me? What a jolly
little cart; have you room for me? I think
I will drive the rest of the way with you. It’s
not far from here, is it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Only a mile or two,” replied Doris. “Yes;
do get in, there’s lots of room; isn’t there,
Patsy?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hapes, miss,” replied Patsy, who was
smouldering with anger at the General’s reference
to the colour of his head.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But is it safe?” asked Mr Boxall, who had
also descended from the waggonette. “Think,
my dear Miss Lestrange, if there was another
accident! Would it not be safer for <i>me</i> to drive
you if you are determined to go in this vehicle?
The children could find accommodation in the
waggonette.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, thanks,” said Miss Lestrange; “it is
just the children I want to talk to.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come on, Boxall,” cried the General; “we
can’t stick here all day. Let her do what she
likes—always will have her own way. Drive
on.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The waggonette and its contents drove on,
and Miss Lestrange got into the “tub.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Just as they were starting a big closed carriage
drove by following in the direction of the waggonette.
It contained Lady Molyneux, her maid,
her pug dogs, and her jewel-case.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ve been to the meet of the hounds,”
explained Lord Gawdor. “That was Bob
Mahony, the sweep, we were racing. He beat
us, but he wouldn’t have beat us if he’d driven
fair. I say, who was that gentleman with the
big white face who wanted to drive you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That was Mr Boxall,” said Miss Lestrange.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He seemed awfully sweet on you,” said
Lord Gawdor. “What’s the matter with his
eyes?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t know,” replied Miss Lestrange,
blushing, “He’s—a Member of Parliament.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, <i>I</i> remember,” said Lord Gawdor. “I
heard granny telling Mrs O’Farrell that poor
Mr Boxall was coming on a visit, and that he’d
got a glass eye. Miss Lestrange!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Bob?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which of his eyes is glass?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>I</i> don’t know,” replied Miss Lestrange.
“Let us talk of something else. Doris, how
is your grandmother?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She’s all right,” said Doris. “Just the
same. Bob kicked his football through the
window the other day, and she kept us prisoners
in the schoolroom two days, and we wouldn’t
have been let go to the meet this morning only
for Mr Fanshawe.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who is Mr Fanshawe?” asked Miss Lestrange,
with a sudden interest in her voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jolliest chap you ever met,” cut in Lord
Gawdor; “isn’t he, Doris?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Rather!” replied Doris.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And he gave Patsy half a crown,” went
on Lord Gawdor—“this is Patsy driving—He’s
off hunting this morning. My! can’t he
ride? And hasn’t he some fine horses?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is he like?” asked Miss Lestrange.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I dunno,” replied Lord Gawdor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s awfully good-looking,” said Doris.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s a rale gintleman,” said Patsy. “Beg
your pardon, miss, for speakin’.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not at all,” said Miss Lestrange, smiling
sweetly on Patsy. On getting into the “tub”
she had looked tired from her journey and bored,
but she was now full of spirits and animation.
“So your name is Patsy, is it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Patsy Rooney, miss,” replied that individual,
as he turned the “tub” in at the gates. “I’m
the page-boy, and clanes the knives and the
boots, but I’m looking afther Mr Fanshawe now,
for his man sprained his fut and had to be left
behind: and it’s only this marnin’ Mr Fanshawe
says to me, ‘Patsy, you’re a jewel at cleanin’
boots and brushing clothes, and if you continy
in the grace of God,’ he says, ‘it’s a valley I’ll
make of you before you’re much older,’ and,
bedad,” finished Patsy, hitting the pony a “skelp”
with the whip, “I’d sooner sarve him for tuppence
a week than any other gintleman in the
country for a pound.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch14' class='c009'>CHAPTER XIV <br /> <br /> A KISS ON THE STAIRS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Mr Boxall was standing in his bedroom preparatory
to dressing for dinner. Mr Boxall,
though a Member of Parliament, and very rich,
went in omnibuses to save cab fares, and his tips to
servants were a disgrace to the giver and receiver.
He also had a nasty and dictatorial way with
him which made him disliked.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Boxall having looked around him for
something he failed to find, rang the bell. The
bell not being answered immediately, he opened
the door and looked out on the corridor, where
Patsy was passing along with a huge can of hot
water.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hi, you, boy!” cried Mr Boxall.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir?” replied Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What do you mean by not attending to my
bell?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Attending to your which, sir?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My bell—are you deaf?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I didn’t know you’d brought one wid you,
sir,” replied Patsy, with an air of injured innocence.
“I was afther fetchin’ this water for
Mr Fanshawe. Did yiz ring it in your room or in
the passidge?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good heavens!” cried Mr Boxall, “does
the boy think I carry a bell about with me like
a muffin man? My bedroom bell, you oaf!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, your bidroom bell,” replied the servitor.
“Sure, it’s ears as long as some people I could
name I’d want to hear it, for it rings in the
kitchen four flights of stairs and twinty-siven
passidges away.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hold your tongue,” replied Mr Boxall.
“And now that you are here, go and fetch me
my dressing-bag.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All your luggage is in your room, sir,” replied
Patsy, “for I helped William, the under-gardner,
with it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come here,” said Mr Boxall, smothering
the resentment with which Patsy as the red-headed
embodiment of the Irish race filled his
Anglo-Saxon spirit. “Now stand in the doorway,
stand fair and square and look around you,
and—if you have eyes in your head—point me
out my dressing-bag.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There it is, sir,” said Patsy, pointing to the
dressing-bag, which was standing in a shady
corner, with a travelling rug half covering it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get out!” said Mr Boxall. He shut the
door in the red-headed one’s face, and Patsy
took up his can of hot water.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll be even wid yiz yet, ould glass eyes!”
said Patsy, as he carried the can towards Mr
Fanshawe’s room.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Fanshawe had not yet returned from the
chase. Patsy put the hot water can down by
the wash-stand, and then looked around to see
what more he could do. Patsy in a few hours
had attached himself to Mr Fanshawe just as a dog
attaches himself to a man. He would have
gone through fire and water for Mr Fanshawe,
but as that was not required of him, he expended
his energy in the polishing of his boots and the
brushing of his clothes.</p>

<p class='c013'>Having looked around and seen that everything
was trim, he went downstairs to help James,
the butler. Half an hour afterwards, coming
up the main staircase on some errand and hearing
the swish of silk, he glanced up and caught a
glimpse of a spacious and portly dame descending
the stairs. It was Lady Molyneux in all her
glory—low evening dress, tiara of diamonds,
necklace of diamonds, bracelets and all.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lady Molyneux, with rather questionable
taste, invariably put on all her diamonds for
dinner. She looked like a jeweller’s shop in
motion, and Patsy, alarmed at having to face
so much magnificence, popped himself behind
the arras on the landing.</p>

<p class='c013'>The arras was old and dusty and smelt of
rats; it was a bit tattered, too, and through a
hole in it Patsy watched Lady Molyneux pass by,
and gasped at the magnificence of the spectacle.</p>

<p class='c013'>The remembrance of Paddy Murphy came to
him with a cold chill; to-night, to-morrow night,
any night now the knock might come to the
window and he would be bound to open it.
He stood reviewing this frightful certainty and
watching the back view of Lady Molyneux as
she descended the stairs. The thought which
had been comforting him for some days past,
that, though he had sworn to open the window
for the burglars he had not sworn not to tell,
came to him, coupled with the recollection of
Mr Fanshawe’s guns.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was just on the point of leaving his hiding-place
when the sound of some one else descending
the stairs made him pause. It was Miss
Lestrange, looking very beautiful in a black
evening dress, and with a rose worn Spanish
fashion in the clouds of her dark hair.</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy was gazing in admiration at this beautiful
vision which was descending towards him when
a hurried step coming <i>up</i> the stairs was heard.
It was Dicky Fanshawe, plastered with mud
from top to toe; he was coming up the stairs
two steps at a time. His left coat sleeve was
nearly ripped out of the coat, and his face was a
mask of mud. He had come a barbed wire
cropper, and had been bogged beyond Shepherd’s
Cross; but he did not seem hurt, and he did not
seem particularly depressed with his misfortunes,
for he was whistling a tune, and he had nearly
cannoned against Miss Lestrange before he saw her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Violet!” cried the young man, drawing
suddenly back.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dicky—Mr Fanshawe!” cried the girl.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then their hands met, and Patsy, behind the
arras, wished that he were somewhere else.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I knew you were coming,” he said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I knew you were here,” said she.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How did you know?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The children told me that a Mr Fanshawe
was here who was awfully jolly, and—very
ugly, so I knew it must be you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You did not get any of the letters I wrote to
you,” he said. “My uncle wrote to me and told
me frankly he had intercepted them, and if I
wrote again he would put you in Chancery or
some nonsense; he’s always blustering and
bellowing—Violet!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t, Dicky—<i>don’t</i>, Mr Fanshawe—some
one may be looking, and your face is all mud.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“So it is,” said Dicky, rubbing it and looking
at his hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is there any on my cheek?” asked she.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let me look—closer——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Dicky!</i>”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go it!” murmured Patsy, behind the arras.
“Give her another wan—she stickin’ her cheek
out for it and thin pretendin’ to be surprised!
Musha! but wimmen are all the same.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The roar of a gong and a step coming down
the stairs brought matters to a swift conclusion.
Miss Lestrange swept downstairs, and Mr Fanshawe
rushed upstairs, nearly running into the
arms of Mr Boxall on the way. When Mr Boxall
had passed, and the coast was clear, Patsy left
his hiding-place and betook him to Mr Fanshawe’s
room.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come in—who’s there?” cried Dicky, at
the knock.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s me, sir; can I be getting you anything?”
replied Patsy, opening the door.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes—here you are!” cried Dicky, who
seemed in wildly high spirits. “Fetch my
evening clothes out of that drawer there—that
was the last gong, was it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir,” replied Patsy. “The dhressing
gong went half an hour ago.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s no time for a bath, then,” said Mr
Fanshawe, scrubbing at himself with a towel.
“How have the children been behaving?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right, sir. After the meet we met the
wagginette with some of the quality in it coming
from the station, and the young lady wid the
black hair got into the tub and drove home with
us.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, she did, did she?” said Mr Fanshawe
in an interested voice, as he brushed away at
his hair.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir; and the big Mimber of Parlimint
wid the white face wanted to get in and drive
her, an’ she up and give him a slap in the face.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She <i>what</i>?” asked Mr Fanshawe, pausing
with a brush in either hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not with her fist but her tongue, sir,” replied
the informant. “‘You can put the childer in the
wagginette, if there’s not room. Let <i>me</i> dhrive
you,’ says he. ‘It’s the childer I wants to talk to,’
says she; and with that he shut up like a tiliscope,
glass eye and all, for they say, sir, he’s got a
glass eye in his head.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Fanshawe chuckled.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr Robert,” continued Patsy, speaking in
an apparently aimless manner, “he says, ‘That
gintleman seems very sweet on you,’ says he;
and with that she blushed up red wid
vixation——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You seem to have very sharp eyes,” said
Mr Fanshawe. “How do you know when a
lady blushes with ‘vixation,’ as you call it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Be the sparks that came into her eyes,”
replied the observer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, now, spark off downstairs,” said Mr
Fanshawe, “and tell them I’ll be down in a
minute, and not to wait dinner for me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir,” replied Patsy, and he “sparked.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch15' class='c009'>CHAPTER XV <br /> <br /> GOING IN TO DINNER</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“Come along, Doris,” said Lord Gawdor, “and
we’ll look at the dishes going in to dinner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a favourite amusement when a dinner-party
was on to hang over the banister rails and
watch the dishes going in, and, sometimes, if,
fortunately, the remains of a jelly or <i>mérangue</i>
were by chance left for a moment on the hall
table before being carted back to the kitchen,
to descend, capture it, carry it upstairs and
devour it in private.</p>

<p class='c013'>They slipped down the stairs to the first landing
and peeped over the banisters. Nothing was going
in yet, the guests were still in the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s quarter past dinner-time,” said Lord
Gawdor; “wonder what they’re waiting for?”</p>

<p class='c013'>As if in answer to his question, a step sounded
on the stairs above and Dicky Fanshawe came
running down.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hullo, kids!” cried Dicky, as he passed
them. He was in too great a hurry to stop.
He took the remaining flight in two or three
steps, and just as he reached the hall the drawing-room
door opened and General Grampound came
out. The General, seeing Dicky, closed the door
behind him and came towards his nephew, looking,
as he came, not unlike a ruffled cockatoo.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s General Grampound,” said Doris.
“Wish we could hear what he’s saying to Mr
Fanshawe.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Looks as if he was wigging him for being
late,” said Bob.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, doesn’t he? He’s his uncle—old beast—look!
he’s quite purple in the face.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look!” said Bob.</p>

<p class='c013'>The drawing-room door had opened, disclosing
Lady Seagrave on the arm of Uncle Molyneux.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There you are, you two,” said her ladyship;
“I had quite determined to dine without you.
General, give your arm to Lady Molyneux. What
have you two been talking so earnestly about?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Roses,” replied Dicky, with a side glance
at Violet Lestrange, who was passing him, on
the arm of Mr Boxall.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m glad they’ve done jawing,” said Lord
Gawdor, when the last of the guests had vanished
into the dining-room; “it’ll be an hour now
before the sweets are brought up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bob,” said Doris, “I believe she’s in love
with him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Miss Lestrange with Mr Fanshawe.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, that rot,” said his lordship. “Girls
are always fallin’ in love with fellows—makes
me sick. Hi, Patsy!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy was passing below carrying a tray
with glasses on it; he did not hear the hail as
Lord Gawdor dared not raise his voice. He
passed on and vanished.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Patsy heard all they were saying,” said
Doris. “I saw him standing and listening at
the passage door leading to the kitchen.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“So did I. I tried to catch his eye, but he
wasn’t looking this way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I think the old General is a beast,” said Doris.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He looks a hot ’un,” said Bob, who was
whistling softly and making little slides down
the banister rails.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You know, at afternoon tea to-day,” said
Doris, “when you upset that plate of cakes,
and then joggled Miss Lestrange’s tea-cup half
into her lap, I heard him saying to the Member
of Parliament man, he said, ‘I don’t care whether
they are the children of a prince or the children
of a Kitmutgar’ (whatever that is), ‘children
all the world over are just the same, and they
are a damned nuisance.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hurroo! who’s swore now?” cried Lord
Gawdor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I didn’t; I only repeated what he said, and
Mr Boxall said he agreed with him——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I <i>say</i>!” cried Lord Gawdor, a happy recollection
crossing his mind, “did you hear what
Selina was saying all the time before gran’ma
rang the bell for Biddy to take her out?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes; she was shouting ‘Grass-eye—grass-eye!’
What did she mean?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d told her before tea that Mr Boxall had
a glass eye, and if she was good maybe he’d
take it out and show it to her.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, that was it, was it?” said Doris. Then
the pair ceased conversation and hung, leaning
over the banister rails, in silence, watching the
dishes going in and coming out.</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy was greatly in evidence going and coming,
and so busy that he never once glanced up. He
was carrying, just now, a <i>vol au vent</i> in a silver
dish; he paused in his passage across the hall
with it, sniffed at it, stuck his thumb in it, sucked
his thumb, wiped it on the side of his trousers,
and then vanished into the dining-room with
the dish.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I hope the old General will have some of
that,” murmured Doris.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch16' class='c009'>CHAPTER XVI <br /> <br /> IN THE “SCRUBBERY”</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>General Grampound and Mr Boxall were
non-smokers, and as Mr Boxall was also a teetotaler,
and the General was talking politics,
Dicky Fanshawe found things rather dull in
the dining-room when the ladies had withdrawn.</p>

<p class='c013'>Things were almost as dull in the drawing-room,
for Lady Seagrave was deaf, and Lady
Molyneux was stupid.</p>

<p class='c013'>I must have presented Patsy very badly if
you have not discovered that he was the possessor
of an “eye”—the eye of an observer. The
faculty of observation given to him by nature
and developed amongst the wild things of the
woods was exercised to the full amidst the new
surroundings in which he found himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had sized up Mr Boxall. He had overheard
the conversation between General Grampound
and his nephew; he, whilst circulating
with dishes and plates behind the chairs of the
guests at table, had gauged the relationship of
each to each. Though half their conversation
was Greek to him, the falsity of it was not; and
there was not a glance between Violet and Dicky,
a side glance of Mr Boxall’s, a grimace of General
Grampound’s, that escaped the awful eye of
Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>These preoccupations did not, however,
interfere in the least with his occupations and
duties, such as handing plates and dishes, devouring
half a neglected custard on its way to the
kitchen, and stuffing his trousers pockets with
fondants and nuts.</p>

<p class='c013'>As the people in the drawing-room were seated,
Lady Molyneux at the table turning over the
leaves of an album, Violet Lestrange by the
fire gazing at the burning logs and Lady Seagrave
nodding in her easy-chair opposite Violet, Patsy
entered with a tray containing coffee.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The childer are in the nursery, miss,” said
Patsy in a low tone, as he presented the tray to
Violet.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was something in the tone of his voice
that said much more than the simple words
implied. In fact, if Patsy had said, “It’s tired
to death you are with these ould women, and
it’s I that am sorry for you,” his meaning would
not have been plainer. Yet there was nothing
disrespectful in his tone at all.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank you, Patsy,” said Violet, taking her
cup. Then, without tasting it, she laid it on
a table near by. “I think I will run up and
say good-night to the children,” said she, rising.
“You don’t mind, do you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not at all,” replied Lady Seagrave. “Give
them my love, and tell them I am pleased they
have managed for one day to behave themselves.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will,” said Violet, and she departed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Scarcely had she vanished upstairs than the
dining-room door opened and Dicky Fanshawe
came out.</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy was lingering about in the hall, and
Dicky called him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which is the way to the ‘scrubbery,’ Patsy?”
said he. “I want to smoke a cigar.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“This way, sir,” said Patsy, leading the way
down a passage, through a swing-door, down
another passage, to a door that was bolted and
which he opened.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Leave the door open,” said Mr Fanshawe.
“I will shut it when I come in.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir,” replied Patsy. “Sure, it’s a fine night
for a smoke under the stars. Mr Fanshawe, sir!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The childer are in the nursery, sir,” said
Patsy in a muted voice, as though he were imparting
some State secret.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, they are, are they?” said Mr Fanshawe,
rather surprised at the mysterious tone of the
communication. “And what are they doing—no
mischief, I hope?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The young lady is wid them,” said Patsy.
“There’s no wan else up there, but, sure, they’re
safe enough wid her.”</p>

<p class='c013'>There was the faintest suspicion of jocularity
in Patsy’s tone, so faint as to be almost indiscernible.
Still it was there, and as there was
nothing jocular in the remark of which the tone
was, so to speak, the envelope, it was more
particularly noticeable.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Patsy!” said Mr Fanshawe, who had taken
a few steps from the door, turning and trying to
make out in the surrounding darkness the small
figure of his informant.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Patsy had vanished.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Confound the boy!” said Mr Fanshawe.
“What did he mean?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Instead of a cigar he took a cigarette from his
pocket, lit it, smoked it half through, flung it
away, and re-entered the house. As he was
crossing the hall he came upon Uncle Molyneux,
who had just escaped from the dining-room, and
who did not look cheerful.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come and have a game of billiards,” said
Uncle Molyneux.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I can’t for a moment,” replied Dicky
hurriedly, “for I’m just running up to the nursery
to say good-night to the children.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch17' class='c009'>CHAPTER XVII <br /> <br /> THE STORY OF THE PIG</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“Now sit down, Bob, and do try to behave
yourself; Selina shall sit in my lap if she will
promise to be good, and I will tell you a story—Doris,
leave the poker alone—Dear me, dear
me,” said Miss Lestrange, suddenly assuming
a grandmotherly tone, “who’d be worried by
children? Where is my snuff-box and my cane?—Well,
then, sit still and count ten to yourselves
all round whilst I think of a story.”</p>

<p class='c013'>She was seated in the old broken-down nursery
rocking-chair with Selina in her lap; there was
no lamp, and the flickering fire-light lit the
interminable man driving his pig to market and
the broom-like tail of the rocking-horse, whose
body was lost in shadow.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ten!” suddenly yelled Lord Gawdor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d only got to nine,” said Doris. “Bob
counts so quick. No matter, begin the story.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I haven’t thought of one yet,” said Miss
Lestrange. “What shall it be? Selina is the
youngest, and she shall choose; what would
you like a story about, Selina?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Pigs!” replied Selina after a moment’s
deliberation, during which her eyes had wandered
round the walls of the room in search of inspiration.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m afraid I can scarcely rise to pigs,” said
Miss Lestrange. “Think again, Selina; shut
your eyes and think hard. How would a story
about a giant do?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Selina thought for a moment, and then, with
the air of a person who had quite made up her
mind:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I want a ’tory about piggy-wiggies.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Try a giant, Selina,” said Doris, in the
coaxing voice of a nurse offering a delicacy to an
invalid.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t <i>want</i> a giant,” replied the pig fancier.
“I want piggy-wiggies.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who’s this that wants piggy-wiggies?”
came a voice from the door. “Oh, I beg pardon—thought
there was no one here. May I come
in?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No room, no room,” cried Miss Lestrange;
“we are telling stories.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s plenty of room,” replied Mr Fanshawe,
paraphrasing the heroine of “Alice in
Wonderland,” and crossing the floor at the same
time. “I say, how jolly you all look sitting
round the fire!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Selina, seeing the newcomer, looked at him
for a moment critically, forgot pigs completely,
and held out her arms to him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Selina has never done that to any one before,”
said Doris; “she hates strangers, as a rule, and
always cries at them.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There, take her,” said Miss Lestrange,
handing the white bundle to Mr Fanshawe,
who sat down with it on the chair vacated by
Bob; “but take the responsibility also—you
have to tell her a story about a pig.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Right,” replied Mr Fanshawe, whilst Selina
settled herself to listen; and Bob and his sister,
who didn’t care much for stories of Selina’s level,
amused themselves on the floor with a clock-work
motor-car which Uncle Molyneux had
brought them from London.</p>

<p class='c013'>The whizz and snarl of the motor-car as it
made frantic gyrations on the nursery floor
half obscured Mr Fanshawe’s voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There was once a little pig,” began Mr
Fanshawe, “and he lived in a sty—I say, things
were pretty dull in the dining-room when you
left. Did you ever hear Boxall on the preferential
tariff question?—Boxall with his muzzle off?
Uncle’s bad to beat when he’s on the first Sikh
war, but Boxall—Yes, yes, Selina, where was
I?—There was once a little pig and he lived in a
sty and he had bran mash for dinner. He had
three little brothers and three little sisters—now
count them to yourself, and I’ll give you a penny
if you tell me how many little brothers and
sisters he had—count them five times over and
I’ll give you tuppence—So I just bolted, and
Patsy said you were here—Do you know Patsy,
the red-headed page-boy?—So I thought I’d
come up and see. Oh, Violet—It’s all right,
I’m not talking loud enough for them to hear—but
I’ve been half cracked for the last few months.
This can’t go on, there’s no use talking. Do
you know why uncle is trying to separate us?
It’s just from viciousness. You don’t know
him; he hates me—why? for no reason at all;
we don’t get on, that’s all—ever since I was a
boy it has been the same. You see, uncle is
like nothing so much in the world as a vicious
old maid who has been crossed in love and hates
to see other people happy. Violet, darling——</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, bother the pigs—Yes, Selina, there were
six little pigs, and one had a gun—here, play
with my watch—Violet, darling, it has come to
this, that both our lives will be wrecked by
that old lunatic if we are not careful—the old
Seagrave woman is aiding and abetting him.
I have lots of money for us both, I love you,
you care for me—let’s go in for a bold stroke.
Look here, he’s always threatening to put you
in Chancery—let’s outwit him. Once you are
married he <i>can’t</i> put you in Chancery, ’cos you’d
be mine then, do you see?—There you are, take
the whole watch and chain and play with it—Let’s
give them all the slip. I’ll get a special
licence, we’ll take the train to Dublin; you can
stop at my aunt’s in Merrion Square—she’s a
regular sportsman—and before they can stop
us we’ll be married. I know it’s awfully sudden
my proposing this, but what am I to do? Look
at us—we can scarcely speak to each other, unless
by strategy. And I know <i>this</i>, unless you do as
I say, we will never be married, for you will
never have strength to resist uncle; he’ll keep
nagging to you till he breaks your spirit. And
that beast of a Boxall—suppose he <i>has</i> got seven
thousand a year, money isn’t happiness tied to
a brute like that. I have three thousand a year
myself, and I’ll give up racing, I’ll give up smoking,
I’ll give up everything for you. Promise me
you’ll think of what I say—Bless you, my darling—Violet,
darling, lean your dear head forward—no—well,
I won’t—Now what is it, Selina——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She has dropped your watch,” said Miss
Lestrange.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And smashed it, too,” replied Mr Fanshawe;
“and cheap at the price—Bless her, she’s asleep.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Selina, suddenly overcome, was in the arms
of slumber, and at that moment the door leading
to the night nursery opened, and Biddy Mahony
entered in search of her charge.</p>

<p class='c013'>“She ought to a’ been in bed an hour ago,”
said Biddy, as she took Selina from Mr Fanshawe;
“but she gets wild when there’s company in the
house, and there’s no sootherin’ her to slape.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Grass-eyes,” muttered Selina, tossing her
arms in slumber as Biddy carried her off.</p>

<p class='c013'>“She’s thinking of Mr. Boxall’s eye,” said
Lord Gawdor. “Mr Fanshawe, one of Mr
Boxall’s eyes is made of glass.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Never mind Mr Boxall’s eyes,” cried Dicky
in wild spirits; “come on, and we’ll have a game
of Blind-man’s Buff.”</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c013'>“I say,” said little Lord Gawdor to Doris
when Dicky and Miss Lestrange had departed,
“when Mr Fanshawe had blinded us both I
just lifted the handkerchief a wee peep, and do
you know what I saw?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know,” replied Doris, “I <i>heard</i> it; but don’t
tell.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Think I’m an ass?” said Lord Gawdor.</p>

  <h2 id='ch18' class='c009'>CHAPTER XVIII <br /> <br /> AN INTERRUPTED FEAST</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>At ten o’clock that night Patsy entered his
bedroom with a tin candlestick in his hand.
He placed the candlestick on the dressing-table,
and, approaching the bed, began to unload his
pockets of plunder; nuts, and almonds, and
raisins, a crystallised apricot and a piece of
green angelica made up the pile which he placed
on the coverlet of the bed, also a huge Tom Smith
cracker with a picture of Miss Marie Studholme
stuck on the gelatine cover.</p>

<p class='c013'>He surveyed the lot with a grin of satisfaction,
sat down on the side of the bed, and was just
setting to work when a scratching noise at the
window drew his attention, and, looking up, he
saw at the pane the white face of Con Cogan.</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy’s jaw dropped, and the walnut which
he was in the act of cracking dropped also, fell
on the floor, and rolled into a corner.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, musha!” said Patsy, “there he is
again!”</p>

<p class='c013'>He got off the bed and, like a fascinated bird,
approached the beckoning form at the window.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is it you want?” asked Patsy, as he
raised the sash. “Sure, the house is all a-bed,
and it’s ruined I’ll be if they hear you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s all that on the bed?” asked Con;
“all them things on the quilt you was eatin’?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure, they’re only some nuts and raisins,”
replied Patsy, who saw his prospective feast
vanishing before him. “What is it you want?
for it’s ruined I’ll be if they hear us.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll come in and help yiz,” said Con, putting
one leg over the sill. “There’s no law in the
land can put a man in prizin for comin’ in to have
supper wid his nephew. It’s afraid I am,” said
Con, putting the other leg over, “that it’s
indisgestion you’ll be havin’. The idea,” went
on he, sitting down on the edge of the bed and
surveying the feast—“the idea of lettin’ childer
stuff thimselves up wid sweets and nuts! It’s
ashamed the ould lady ought to be of herself.
Sit down on the bed beside me, Patsy Rooney,
and there’s a walnut for you. I’ll attind to
the sweets.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He put the crystallised apricot in his mouth,
and Patsy, with the walnut in his hand, sat
watching his treasures vanishing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’re not eatin’ your nuts,” said Mr Cogan,
as he swallowed the last of the chocolates and set
to on the nuts.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is it you’re afther?” said Patsy,
whose appetite had completely disappeared.
“What’s made you come to-night at all, at all?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Cogan cracked a walnut and devoured the
contents.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And what’s this?” said he, taking up the
cracker, without replying to Patsy’s very pertinent
question.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thims is crackers,” replied Patsy in a half-hearted
voice. “Is it Paddy Murphy’s job you’re
afther, or what?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And who’s the girl, may I ax?” went on
Mr Cogan, examining Miss Studholme with a
critical and approving eye.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I dunno,” replied Patsy. “Sure, it’s
moidhered I am! What is it you’re afther,
Con Cogan?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is it to eat, or what?” asked Mr Cogan,
still disregarding Patsy, and touching the gelatine
cover with his tongue.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stop, or it’s pizened you’ll be,” said Patsy;
“it’s not for eatin’. You catch hould of it at
both ends, same as you have it now, and pull;
but don’t be doin’ it, or——”</p>

<p class='c013'>Bang!</p>

<p class='c013'>Next moment Mr Cogan was across the floor
and out of the window.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I told you not,” said Patsy, who had his
hand on the sash. “Run, before the house is up
and afther you!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why didn’t yiz tell me there was gunpowdher
in it?” asked Con, whose teeth were
chattering. “Stick your ear out of the window,
for this is what I’ve come afther. Paddy Murphy
will be here at twelve o’clock to-morra night;
he’ll be here at the window and give two taps—rimimber
what you swore.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Con!” said Patsy, leaning out into the
darkness; but the valiant Con had vanished.</p>

<p class='c013'>Upstairs Mr Fanshawe had slipped on an old
shooting jacket, and, quite forgetful of all Lady
Seagrave’s prohibitions about tobacco, was enjoying
a cigar by his bedroom fire.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was not dissatisfied with his day. He
had had a good run with the hounds, and he
had been extraordinarily successful in securing
a long uninterrupted talk with Violet Lestrange,
to say nothing of the Blind-man’s Buff, yet he
was disturbed in his mind and anxious.</p>

<p class='c013'>He knew quite well that if he did not succeed
in marrying the girl he loved by strategy, he
would never marry her at all. General Grampound
was not a bad man; he was worse, he was
a coldly pig-headed man. He was also a match-maker.
Match-making (I do not refer to Lucifers)
is an Army disease; it is caught from living
in warm climates; it attacks colonels and generals,
and they never recover from it.</p>

<p class='c013'>To be a match-maker you must also be a
match-breaker. In other words, if you mix
and meddle in other people’s love affairs you
must inevitably do mischief.</p>

<p class='c013'>The General was determined that Violet
Lestrange should marry Mr Boxall, M.P., because,
from the General’s point of view, Mr Boxall,
M.P., was a “good match.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Boxall was fat, and rather plain, and had
a glass eye; that did not matter in the least to
the General. Had you remonstrated with him,
he would probably have answered you, “Dash,
it, sir—the girl’s not going to marry the fellow’s
glass eye! He has seven thousand a year, and
a tin mine; what more do you want? He
doesn’t smoke, he doesn’t play cards, he doesn’t
read novels or fritter his time away in rubbish;
what more do you want? He’s strong on army
reform, and he’s sound on the tariff question;
what more do you want? I’ve made up my
mind she shall marry him, and marry him she
will, if he had a hundred glass eyes—what do
you mean, sir, by shoving your oar in and
mixing and meddling in other people’s
businesses?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Dicky knew his uncle, and that is why he
felt it to be impossible to marry her in the ordinary
fashion. The only chance was to make a runaway
match of it, and do it quick. Yet there
were great difficulties in the way. Tullagh
station was fifteen miles from Glen Druid. Violet
was watched. To get a moment’s conversation
with her alone was a most difficult business.</p>

<p class='c013'>If Violet and he were missed for an hour,
search would inevitably be made for them;
they would be pursued and captured.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr Fanshawe, sir!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Fanshawe turned in his chair with a start.
The door was open, and Patsy was standing in
the doorway.</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy had the appearance of a sleep-walker
burthened with a nightmare.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hulloo!” said Mr Fanshawe. “What’s the
matter—what the deuce——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr Fanshawe, sir,” said Patsy, then he
paused, rubbed his knuckles in his eyes and
broke out, blubbering. “It’s I that am in
the thruble and all—it’s I that am in the thruble
and all,” blubbered Patsy,—“thinkin’ of yiz
lyin’ murthered in your beds, and the young
lady and the childer! Oh, wirra, wirra! it’s
ten fut under the sod I wish I was before I ever
see this day!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“God bless the boy!” said Mr Fanshawe.
“What on earth has happened? Who’s murdering
who, and what’s it all about?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I didn’t swear not to tell on thim—bad
luck to thim!” said Patsy, rubbing his nose
with the back of his hand and suppressing his
sobs. “It’s the burgulars I tould you of, Mr
Fanshawe.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What burglars?” asked Mr Fanshawe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The ones I tould you I dhramed of,” replied
Patsy. “I wasn’t dhramin’ at all——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then what on earth were you doing?” asked
Mr Fanshawe, in whose mind vague suspicious
of Patsy’s sanity were beginning to arise.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I was only pritindin’,” replied Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look here,” said Mr Fanshawe, “just pull
yourself together and clear your mind—what’s
all this about burglars and murderers? Out
with it, you young beggar, before I take a hunting
crop to you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Encouraged like this, Patsy told his tale.</p>

<p class='c013'>“To-morrow night at twelve, do you say?”
asked Mr Fanshawe. “Why, the matter is
simple enough: we must tell the police, that’s
all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The p’leece!” said Patsy with fine contempt.
“Sure, the p’leece are all at the other side of
the country where the cattle dhrivin’ is goin’
on. Mr Fanshawe, sir!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Patsy?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I was thinkin’ if you was to load wan of
thim guns of yours up to the muzzle wid
bu’lets——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Patsy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And stand with it in your fist close to the
wall of me room be the window. I’d open the
sash. Paddy Murphy would stick the ugly head
of him into the room——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Patsy?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thin you’d let fly wid the gun and blow it
aff him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, you murderous young devil,” said Mr
Fanshawe, “do you know what you are proposing—do
you know you could be hanged for doing
that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“For doin’ which, sir?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Which!</i>—blowing a man’s head off like that.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure, who’d know?” replied the other.
“The p’leece would be so glad to be shut of him,
they’d never ax no questions; and wouldn’t he
<i>desarve</i> it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t know anything about Mr Murphy’s
deserts,” said Mr Fanshawe; “he may be bad
enough, but I’m not going to assassinate him in
cold blood. Patsy, can you keep a secret?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Tight as a drum,” replied Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, don’t say a word of this to any one,
and to-morrow night we may have some fun
with Mr Murphy. Did you ever catch a rabbit
in a snare, Patsy?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy grinned.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, the idea has just come to me that
we may be able to arrange something of that
sort for Mr Murphy. I only want a pulley and
some rope—stay, I have it: you know the flagstaff
on the roof?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, there must be twenty yards or so of
signal-halyard line on it. You know what I
mean—the rope they pull the flag up on.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, to-morrow you must get me that rope;
it will do in the evening time after dinner. Is
there anything I can fix a pulley to in the ceiling?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure, there’s a big oak beam that’d hould an
iliphant,” said Patsy, whose rabbit-snaring instincts
told him something of the plan which
had occurred to Mr Fanshawe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That will do. Now cut off to bed, and
mind you say nothing of this to any one. It
isn’t every day one has the chance of trapping
a burglar. The beagles meet to-morrow at ten,
don’t they?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir, at the park gates,” replied Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Right!” said Mr Fanshawe. “Be sure and
call me at eight.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch19' class='c009'>CHAPTER XIX <br /> <br /> SHAN</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>The Castle Knock beagles were a mixed pack
of tall hare-hounds and tiny rabbit-beagles.
Nearly every cottager boarded a dog; Mr French
(a cousin of Mr O’Farrell, the Master of the
Hounds) supplied most of the money requisite,
and Shan Finucane was the huntsman.</p>

<p class='c013'>Shan had been after hares for thirty years or
so. He was a cadaverous-looking person with
solid leather lungs, a face the colour of mahogany
(almost), an eye like a gimlet, and an old green
coat with three brass buttons on it. A battered
old hunting horn, and a whip with a leaden ball
on the top of it completed Shan’s rig-out.</p>

<p class='c013'>Shan was great in the field, absolute master
of all he surveyed; to see him, with the cry of
the dogs answering his cry of “Forrard, forrard,”
to see him with the tails of his old tattered coat
flying in the air as he took bank and bramble
hedge, mud-spattered, hallooing, exultant and
glorious, was to see a sight you were not likely
to forget in a hurry.</p>

<p class='c013'>Though the beagles were good sport, and their
runs sometimes attended by the “quality,”
a section of the sporting community of Castle
Knock turned up its nose at them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Billy the Buck, for instance, would, so he
declared, have sooner been found dead in a
ditch than “runnin’ afther them baygles.”
The little short runs that a hare afforded were
no use to Billy: great stretches of country were
the desire of his soul; besides, he was at mortal
enmity with Shan.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Mahony, the sweep, was also an anti-beagleite.
His donkey-cart was never seen at
a meet of “thim tarriers,” as he called them.
The fact of the matter being that Mr Mahony
hated to be outshone. He was the sporting
oracle of the village. Two years ago he had
backed “Ballybrack” at the Tullagh races.
No one else had spotted the horse as a winner;
it had started at thirty to one, and Mr Mahony
had scooped thirty pounds, and been wheeled
home under a pig-net in a wheel-barrow. Though
he had backed several losers since then, his word
was still law on all matters concerning sport, and
the airs put on by Shan when he was hunting
with his “tarriers” vexed the soul of Mr Mahony.</p>

<p class='c013'> At nine o’clock of this bright, grey winter’s
morning, coming along the broad high-road
from Kilgobbin through air delicious with the
scent of turf smoke from the cottages and the
smell of the good brown earth, you might have
seen Shan Finucane in all his glory, half a dozen
couples of dogs at his heels, and his old whip
under his arm.</p>

<p class='c013'>When he reached the entrance to the village
of Castle Knock he blew a note on his horn.</p>

<p class='c013'>The effect was magical. Heads popped out
of doors, children ran into the street, pigs
stopped grubbing in the road and cocked their
eyes over their shoulders in the direction of
the sound; the Castle Knock inn vomited its
customers from the bar parlour into the roadway,
and from a cottage door here and there
shot a dog, a beagle-boarder who joined the
pack that was half following, half surrounding
the huntsman.</p>

<p class='c013'>From backyards you could hear shouts of
“Who’s blowin’ the horn?” and answering
shouts, “It’s Shan and the dogs.” Down the
street, all besprinkled with people, every one
gave the huntsman good-day, jocularly or otherwise.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-mornin’ to you, Shan,” “Top of the
mornin’ to you, Shan,” “Yiv lost a button
from your coat, Shan,” “Shan, you’re bustin’
at the elbows,”—through all of which marched
the huntsman supremely indifferent, till he
reached the inn front, where he drew up, nodded
to the landlord, and surveyed his dogs.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was now after nine, the meet took place at
ten, at the gates of Glen Druid House; that
is to say the nominal meet—this was the real one.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where are you goin’ to try first, Shan?”
asked a burly farmer.</p>

<p class='c013'>Shan, without replying, shoved his old cap
back from his forehead and re-surveyed his dogs.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s wan short,” said he, “ould Rafter,
that boards at Finnegan’s. Run, Bob Murphy,
and don’t stop to pick yourself up if y’ tumble
down, and give me respects to the Widdy Finnegan.
Ax her to loose the dog; she has him shut
in the ould pig-sty, most like. She hasn’t tumbled
to the chune of the horn, for she’s as deaf as a
coffin, and half moidhered in her mind. What
was you axing me, Mr O’Rourke?”</p>

<p class='c013'>The farmer repeated his question.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Tare an’ ages!” cried Shan, letting fly his
whip at a harrier that had got a rabbit-beagle
down on its back and was making for a hold in
its throat, “them two dogs is the Siamese twins
for fighting. Loose her, you baste, or I’ll cut
the coat off your back! What is this you were
sayin’, Mr O’Rourke?”</p>

<p class='c013'>The farmer, who had “tumbled” to the
reason of Shan’s deafness, produced a flask
from his pocket.</p>

<p class='c013'>Shan applied it to his lips, half emptied it,
replaced the cork, wiped his mouth with the
back of his hand and was about to give the
required information, when, bursting through
the crowd, came Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shan,” cried Patsy, “I’ve run hot-fut from
the Big House to tell yiz the quality are comin’
to the meet, and you’re to wait for thim if so
be they’re late.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Listen to that now!” murmured the
surrounding throng.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Right y’ are, Patsy,” replied Shan, with a
glitter in his eye, for the presence of the “quality”
meant tips, and maybe a subscription to the pack.
“And how many of them are coming, Patsy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Faith, I dinno,” replied Patsy; “but Mr
Fanshawe is comin’, sure, and he never pulls out
less than a suverin when he puts his hand in his
pocket. And then there’s the Mimber of Parliament,
and the ould Gineral, and the young lady
wid the blew eyes, and the childer—and it’s
back I must be runnin’, or it’s me place I’ll be
losin’.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Away wid yiz, then!” cried Shan; and
Patsy departed, running.</p>

<p class='c013'>That morning at eight, when Patsy had brought
up Mr Fanshawe’s shaving water, the latter had
handed to him a note which he had written
before going to bed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Patsy,” said Mr Fanshawe, “you’re a boy
I can trust; there’s a note there on the dressing-table—do
you see it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I do, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, it’s for the young lady—Miss Lestrange.
I want you to give it to her; but, look here,
Patsy, I don’t want any one to know about
it——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure, I could slip it under her door,” said
Patsy; “she slapes in the room next to her
ladyship.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, that will do. It’s only a note asking
her to go to the meet this morning; it’s at ten,
you say?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Tin o’clock at the big gates,” replied Patsy.
“Shan Finucane is the huntsman, and he’ll be
in the village collecting the dogs be nine. I’ll just
slip down to him and tell him not to start wid the
dogs till you’re on the spot; it’s plazed he’ll be to
wait, for it’s not often the quality follows the dogs,
only Mr Frinch, and the village rubbish, and maybe
a farmer or two from Tullagh way. Is there
anything else I can be gettin’ you, Mr Fanshawe?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, that’s all,” replied Mr Fanshawe. “Just
put the note under the door, as you say, and
don’t let any one see you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>There was nothing treasonable in the note;
it ran:—</p>

<p class='c021'>“Come to the meet of the beagles this morning.
Some of the rest of them are sure to go, but we
may find an opportunity to have a few words
together. <i>Put on a short skirt and a pair of thick
boots.</i> Excuse these rather mysterious instructions,
but I have a reason for it. <span class='sc'>Dick.</span>”</p>

<p class='c013'>When he came downstairs the General was
helping himself to chicken and tongue at the
sideboard, Mr Boxall was spreading his serviette
across his knees, and Violet Lestrange, in the
absence of Lady Seagrave and Lady Molyneux,
both late risers, was presiding at the teapot
behind the huge copper urn, still to be found a
relic of the past here and there in Irish country
houses.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Morning!” said Dicky.</p>

<p class='c013'>He could not see Violet’s boots or skirt, for
they were under the table, but she was in tweed,
and had an open-airy look.</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy, as Mr Fanshawe took his seat, was
placing a toast-rack on the other side of the
table, and as Mr Fanshawe’s eye caught Patsy’s
eye, Patsy winked.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a wonderful wink, for there was not
a trace of familiarity or disrespect in it. The
face was perfectly immovable, the left eye closed
for the hundredth part of a second, that was all;
but what a lot of meaning that insignificant
muscular movement conveyed! It told that
the message had been delivered, but it said a lot
more. It conveyed the impression that all was
well, that Patsy in some miraculous way had
discovered that Miss Lestrange had fallen in
with Dicky’s suggestion, and that he, Patsy,
was on the watch ready to assist matters to the
uttermost, and to exercise secrecy and dispatch.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who’s coming to the meet?” asked Violet,
as she poured out Mr Fanshawe’s tea.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What meet?” asked Dicky.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The beagles,” she replied. “Patsy, what
time do the beagles meet to-day?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Tin o’clock, miss, at the park gates.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m not,” replied Dicky. “Too stiff; besides,
running after beagles is not in my line.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Too stiff!” growled the General, who had
taken his seat opposite Dicky—“too lazy, you
mean—Pass me the mustard—The young men
of to-day aren’t the young men of my time.
Why, a twenty-mile run over the country when
I was your age was only exercise—gentle exercise,
sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll come,” said Mr Boxall, “if I shall not
be in the way. There is no necessity to follow
the hounds. It is a long while since I have
indulged in any description of sport; in fact, I
have not seen a fox for years.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy, who was handing a dish of kippered
herrings to Mr Fanshawe, very nearly exploded.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I believe beagles generally hunt hares,”
said Mr Fanshawe. “But, as you all seem so
active, I’ll join you. It’s after nine now, Patsy;
you’d better be off and tell them to hold on and not
start till we come.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was ten minutes past ten when the party,
Violet and General Grampound walking first,
Mr Fanshawe and Mr Boxall following, neared
the park gates.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Listen!” said Violet, as they drew near the
end of the drive.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, God bless my soul,” said the General,
“it sounds like a faction fight or a fair!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch20' class='c009'>CHAPTER XX <br /> <br /> THE MEET OF THE BEAGLES</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Directly Patsy had left the news that the
“quality” were coming to the meet and returned
to the house, the crowd in front of the Castle
Knock inn thickened.</p>

<p class='c013'>Word of the impending event went from cabin
to cabin, and Mr Mahony, the chimney sweep,
put his head out of his door.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the news, Rafferty?” cried Mr
Mahony.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mimber of Parlymint and all the quality
comin’ to the meet!” cried a ragged-looking
ruffian who was running by.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure, it’ll be a big day for Shan Finucane,”
said Mrs Mahony, who was standing behind her
husband in the doorway with a baby in her arms.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Mahony said nothing for a while, but
watched the crowd in front of the inn.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look at him,” said Mr Mahony, breaking
out at last—“look at him in his ould green coat!
Look at him with the ould whip undher his arm,
and the boots on his feet not paid for, and him
struttin’ about as if he was the Marquis of Watherford!
Holy Mary! did yiz ever see such an
objick! Mr Mullins!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Halloo!” replied Mr Mullins, the cobbler
across the way, who, with his window open
owing to the mildness of the weather, was
whaling away at a shoe-sole, the only busy man
in the village.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Did y’ hear the news?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What news?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shan’s going to get a new coat.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Faith, thin, I hope he’ll pay first for his
ould shoes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How much does he owe you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Siven and six—bad cess to him!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’ll pay you to-night, if he doesn’t drink
the money first, for there’s a Mimber of Parlymint
goin’ to the meet, and he’ll most like put a suverin
in the poor box.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Mullins made no reply, but went on whaling
away at his shoe, and Bob Mahony, having
stepped into his cottage for a light for his pipe,
came back and took up his post again at the door.</p>

<p class='c013'>The crowd round the inn was growing bigger
and bigger. Sneer as he might, Mr Mahony
could not but perceive that Shan was having
the centre of the stage, a worshipping audience,
and free drinks.</p>

<p class='c013'>Suddenly he turned to his offspring, who were
crowding behind him, and singling out Billy,
the eldest:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Put the dunkey to,” said Mr Mahony.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure, daddy,” cried the boy in astonishment,
“it’s only the tarriers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Put the dunkey to!” thundered his father,
“or it’s the end of me belt I’ll be brightenin’
your intellects with.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s two bags of sut in the cart and the
brushes,” said Billy, as he made off to do as
he was bidden.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lave them in,” said Mr Mahony; “it’s
only the tarriers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In a few minutes the donkey, whose harness
was primitive and composed mainly of rope,
was put to, and the vehicle was at the door.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bob!” cried his wife, as he took his seat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is it?” asked Mr Mahony, taking the
reins.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Won’t you be afther givin’ your face the
lick of a tow’l?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s only the tarriers,” replied Mr Mahony;
“sure, I’m clane enough for them. Come up wid
you, Norah.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Norah, the small donkey, whose ears had been
cocking this way and that, picked up her feet,
and the vehicle, which was not much bigger than
a costermonger’s barrow, started.</p>

<p class='c013'>At this moment, also, Shan and the dogs
and the crowd were getting into motion, making
down the road for Glen Druid gates.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hulloo! hulloo! hulloo!” cried Mr Mahony,
as he rattled up behind in the cart, “where are
yiz off to?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The meet of the baygles,” replied twenty
voices; whilst Shan, who had heard his enemy’s
voice, stalked on, surrounded by his dogs, his
old battered hunting horn in one hand, and his
whip under his arm.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And where are they goin’ to meet?” asked
Mr Mahony.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glen Druid gate,” replied the camp followers.
“There’s a Mimber of Parlymint comin’, and
all the quality from the Big House.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Faith,” said Mr Mahony, “I thought there
was somethin’ up, for, by the look of Shan as he
passed me house this mornin’, I thought he’d
swallowed the Lord Liftinant, Crown jewels and
all. Hulloo! hulloo! hulloo! make way for
me carridge! Who are you crowdin’? Don’t
you know the Earl of Leinsther when y’ see
him? Out of the way, or I’ll call me futman
to disparse yiz.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Shan heard it all, but marched on. He could
have killed Bob Mahony, who was turning his
triumph into a farce, but he contented himself
with letting fly with his whip amongst the dogs,
and blowing a note on his horn.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s that nize?” enquired Mr Mahony,
with a wink at the delighted crowd tramping
beside the donkey-cart.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shan’s blowin’ his harn,” yelled the rabble.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Faith, I thought it was Widdy Finnegan’s
rooster he was carryin’ in the tail pockit of his
coat,” said the humorist.</p>

<p class='c013'>The crowd roared at this conceit, which was
much more pungent and pointed as delivered
in words by Mr Mahony; but Shan, to all appearances,
was deaf.</p>

<p class='c013'>The road opposite the park gates was broad
and shadowed by huge elm trees, which gave
the spot in summer the darkness and coolness
of a cave. Here Shan halted, the crowd halted,
and the donkey-cart drew up.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Mahony tapped the dottle out of his pipe
carefully on the rail of his cart, filled the pipe,
replaced the dottle on the top of the tobacco,
and drew a whiff.</p>

<p class='c013'>The clock of Glen Druid House struck ten,
and the notes came floating over park and trees;
not that any one heard them, for the yelping
of the dogs and the noise of the crowd filled
the quiet country road with the hubbub of a
fair.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s that you were axing me?” cried
Mr Mahony to a supposed interrogator in the
crowd. “Is the Prince o’ Wales comin’? No,
he ain’t. I had a tellygrum from him this
mornin’ sendin’ his excuzes. Will some gintleman
poke that rat-tarrier out that’s got under
the wheels of me carridge—out, you baste!”
He leaned over and hit a rabbit-beagle that had
strayed under the donkey-cart a tip with his stick.
The dog, though not hurt, for Bob Mahony was
much too good a sportsman to hurt an animal,
gave a yelp.</p>

<p class='c013'>Shan turned at the sound, and his rage exploded.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who are yiz hittin’?” cried Shan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m larnin’ your dogs manners,” replied Bob.</p>

<p class='c013'>The huntsman surveyed the sweep, the cart,
the soot bags, and the donkey.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I beg your pardin’,” said he, touching his
hat, “I didn’t see you at first for the sut.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Mahony took his short pipe from his mouth,
put it back upside down, shoved his old hat
further back on his head, rested his elbows on
his knees and contemplated Shan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But it’s glad I am,” went on Shan, “you’ve
come to the meet and brought a mimber of the
family with you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Fate was against Bob Mahony, for at that
moment Norah, scenting another of her species
in a field near by, curled her lip, stiffened her
legs, projected her head, rolled her eyes, and
“let a bray out of her” that almost drowned
the howls of laughter from the exulting mob.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Shan Finucane did not stir a muscle of
his face, and Bob Mahony’s fixed sneer did not
flicker or waver.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t mention it, mum,” said Shan, taking
off his old cap when the last awful, rasping,
despairing note of the bray had died down into
silence.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another howl from the onlookers, which left
Mr Mahony quite unmoved.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They get on well together,” said he, addressing
an imaginary acquaintance in the crowd.
“Whisht and hould your nize, and let’s hear
what else they have to say to wan another.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Suddenly, and before Shan Finucane could
open his lips, a boy who had been looking over
the rails into the park, yelled:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Here’s the Mimber of Parlyment—here they
come—Hurroo!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, then,” said the huntsman, dropping
repartee and seizing the sweep’s donkey by the
bridle, “sweep yourselves off, and don’t be
disgracin’ the hunt wid your sut-bags and your
dirty faces—away wid yiz!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The hunt!” yelled Mahony, with a burst of
terrible laughter. “Listen to him and his ould
rat-tarriers callin’ thim a hunt! Lave go of the
dunkey!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Away wid yiz!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lave go of the dunkey, or I’ll batter the
head of you in wid me stick! Lave go of the
dunkey!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Suddenly seizing the long flue brush beside him,
and disengaging it from the bundle of sticks
with which it was bound, he let fly with the
bristle end of it at Shan, and Shan, catching
his heel on a stone, went over flat on his back
in the road.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a second he was up, whip in hand; in a
second Mr Mahony was down, a bag half filled
with soot—a terrible weapon of assault—in his
fist.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Harns! harns!” yelled Mahony, mad with
the spirit of battle, and unconsciously chanting
the fighting cry of long-forgotten ancestors.
“Who says cruckeder than a ram’s harn!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go it, Shan!” yelled the onlookers. “Give
it him, Bob—sut him in the face—Butt-end the
whip, y’ idgit—Hurroo! Hurroo! Holy Mary!
he nearly landed him then—Mind the dogs——”</p>

<p class='c013'>Armed with the soot bag swung like a club,
and the old hunting whip butt-ended, the two
combatants formed the centre of a circle of
yelling admirers.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look!” said Miss Lestrange, as the party
from the house came in view of the road. “Look
at the crowd and the two men!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They’re fighting!” cried the General. “I
believe the ruffians have dared to have the
impudence to start fighting!”</p>

<p class='c013'>At this moment came the noise of wheels from
behind, and the “tub,” which had obtained
permission to go to the meet, drew up, with
Patsy driving the children.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let the children remain here,” said the
General. “You stay with them, Violet. Come
along, Boxall, till we see what these ruffians
mean.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So filled was his mind with the objects in
view that he quite forgot Dicky Fanshawe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You <i>have</i> put on the short skirt,” said Dicky,
who at that moment would scarcely have turned
his head twice or given a second thought had
the battle of Austerlitz been in full blast beyond
the park palings.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And my thick boots,” said Violet, pushing
forward a delightful little boot to speak for itself.</p>

<p class='c013'>The children were so engaged watching the
proceedings on the road that they had no eyes
or ears for their elders.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Have you ever been beagling before?”
asked Dicky.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Never; but I’ve been paper-chasing.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You can get through a hedge?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Rather!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’ll do,” said Dicky.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr Fanshawe,” cried Lord Gawdor from
the “tub,” “look at the chaps in the road—aren’t
they going for each other!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I see,” said Mr Fanshawe, whose back was
to the road—“Violet——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No one’s looking——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That doesn’t matter—<i>No</i>—not here—Dicky,
if you don’t behave, I’ll get into the tub—Gracious!
what’s that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s down!” cried Patsy, who had been
standing up to see better.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who?” asked Mr Fanshawe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Mimber of Parlyment—Misther Boxall—Bob
Mahony’s grassed him——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They’re <i>all</i> fighting!” cried Violet. “Come,
Mr Fanshawe—Patsy——” She started for the
gates at a run.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch21' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXI <br /> <br /> MR BOXALL GETS IN THE WAY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>When the General had arrived on the scene,
Shan had just got in and landed his antagonist
a drum-sounding blow on the ribs with the butt
of his whip.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seize the other chap, Boxall!” cried General
Grampound, making for Mahony.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was just half a second too late; the soot
bag, swung like a club, missed Shan, and, catching
Mr Boxall fair and square on the side of his face,
sent him spinning like a tee-totum across the
road, and head over heels in the ditch.</p>

<p class='c013'>That was all.</p>

<p class='c013'>A dead silence took the yelling crowd.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s kilt!” came a voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He isn’t; sure, his legs is wavin’.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who is he?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s the Mimber of Parlyment.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Off wid you, Bob Mahony—you’ve kilt
the Mimber of Parlyment! Run for your life,
and don’t lave off runnin’ till you’re out of the
county.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hold your tongue!” cried General Grampound.
“Boxall—hullo! Boxall! are you
hurt?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m all right,” replied Mr Boxall, who,
from being legs upwards, was now on hands
and knees in the ditch. “I’ve lost something—dash
it!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What have you lost?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Watch.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come out, and I’ll get some of these chaps
to look.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Boxall came out of the ditch with his
handkerchief held to the left side of his forehead.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, your watch and chain are on you!”
cried the General.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So they are,” said Mr Boxall, pulling the
watch out with his left hand, and putting it
back. “I’m off to the house—I want to wash.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure you’re not hurt?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not in the least, only my forehead scratched.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s up?” cried Dicky Fanshawe, who
had just arrived.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing,” replied his uncle. “Fellow hit
him by mistake—no bones broken. Will you
take the governess-cart back to the house,
Boxall?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No thanks—I’ll walk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“His legs is all right,” murmured the sympathetic
crowd, as the injured one departed still
with his handkerchief to his face, “and his arums.
Sure, it’s the mercy and all his neck wasn’t bruck.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Did yiz see the skelp Bob landed him?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Musha! Sure, I thought it would have
sent his head flying into Athy, like a gulf ball.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy, who had pulled the governess-cart up,
rose to his feet; his sharp eye had caught sight
of something lying on the road.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hould the reins a moment, Mr Robert,”
said he, putting them into Lord Gawdor’s hands.
He hopped out of the cart, picked up the object
in the road, whatever it was, put it in his trousers
pocket, and then stood holding the pony’s head;
whilst the meet, from which Bob Mahony had
departed as swiftly as his donkey could trot,
turned its attention to the business of the day,
and Shan, collecting his dogs, declared his intention
of drawing the Furzes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Was that a marble you picked up, Patsy?”
asked Lord Gawdor, as the red-headed one,
hearing Shan’s declaration, climbed into the
“tub” again and took the reins.</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy grinned.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Be sittin’ still, now,” said he, hitting the
pony a flick with the whip, “or the ould General
will, maybe, be sendin’ us back. It’s the Furzes
Shan’s goin’ to draw.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But was it a marble, Patsy?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look at Shan and the dogs and ould Rafter
cockin’ his tail,” said Patsy. “It’s the fine
sport we’ll be havin’ if there’s a hare in the Furzes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The Furzes, a tract of waste land bordering
a big stretch of ploughed fields and arable land,
was reached in twenty minutes’ walk, General
Grampound walking between Dick and Violet
and rigorously dividing them.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a splendid day for the business—one
of those grey, damp days one gets only in Ireland.</p>

<p class='c013'>The company spread itself a bit, and Shan
was assailed by all sorts of suggestions and queries.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Try the fields, Shan.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Try the garse bushes over beyant the rise.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The ould quarry hole, Shan.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure, there’s a herd of hares in the hollow
beyant the scrub firs.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Niver you listen to thim, Shan; it’s in the
Sivin Acres you ought to be tryin’.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile, Shan, supremely indifferent to
advice and suggestions, began to draw the
adjacent cover.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I do hope they’ll find a hare,” said Miss
Lestrange, whose eyes were sparkling.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hare!” said the General, “I don’t believe
there’s one in the county. Every one of these
blessed small tenants owns a gun of some sort,
and they’re poachers to a man.”</p>

<p class='c013'>At that instant, as if to give him the lie, came
a “view halloa!” from Micky Finnegan away
to the right where the fence divided the scrub
land from the fields.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a second Rafter, followed by the pack, Shan,
and all the field was making towards the sound.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Run!” cried Dicky, as he started after
them, followed by Violet and General Grampound,
who, despite the fact that his wind wasn’t “what
it used to be,” managed to keep up with them.</p>

<p class='c013'>The dogs were just laid on, and every hound
gave tongue as they streamed through the fence
and over the ploughed land followed by Shan,
who took the fence like a grasshopper, and the
yelling field.</p>

<p class='c013'>Over the sound of the dogs, over the laughter
and shouts, over everything came Shan’s
“Forrard! forrard! forrard! Hi up, y’ divils!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Over you go!” cried Dicky, who had taken
the fence at a jump, whilst Violet, scrambling
over, nearly tumbled into his arms. “It’s only
a short bit of plough, and there’s grass fields
beyond.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look at thim!” cried Patsy, who, with the
children, was standing up in the “tub.” “Look
at the ould Gineral getting over the fence; he’s
callin’ thim to stop! Brayvo, Mr Fanshawe!
Look at the ould Gineral—look at him goin’
over the plough—they’re through the hedge
beyant. He’s afther thim—he’s through! He
ain’t—he’s slipped and over on his back. Hurroo!
brayvo, Mr Fanshawe! They’re half over the
grass field.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Run!” cried Dicky, as he dragged his
companion through an opening in the hedge,
dividing the plough from the grass lands.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, Dicky,” gasped the girl, half dead with
running, and laughing at the same time, “listen
to him!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know,” said he. “It’s horrible—but’s it’s
our only chance to have a minute together.
Cling on to the end of my stick, it’ll help you.
This grass isn’t bad going.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s in the ditch!” gasped Violet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s soft—he won’t hurt—run!”</p>

  <h2 id='ch22' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXII <br /> <br /> LOVE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“Where are the dogs and things?” asked Miss
Lestrange, as she sat on a grassy bank under the
shelter of a thick hedge, panting and arranging
her hat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>I</i> don’t know,” replied Mr Fanshawe. “I
only know <i>he</i> must be a couple of miles away.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“This was the reason you wanted me to put
on the short skirt.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes. Wasn’t a bad idea—was it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t know,” sighed she, in a despairing
way, and then burst out laughing. “I’m not
laughing at him—it’s the whole thing—that man
hitting Mr Boxall over the head with a bag of
soot—and the little donkey-cart—and that man
in the old green coat with the whip—and his
tumbling into the ditch, and all these people
running after the hounds——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And our running away!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And our running away!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bother!” said Dicky.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the matter?” asked Miss Lestrange,
who had drawn a long pin from her hat, and was
now reinserting it daintily with both hands upheld.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I was thinking,” said Dicky, “that as we
had run away so far we might complete the job,
only——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Only what?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve only five and sixpence in my pockets.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is my hat straight?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Perfectly—I wish you’d be serious.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Serious about running away with only five
and sixpence between us?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, it’s not that,” he replied rather grumpily.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was silence, for a moment. The ground
here was high, and gave a view of vast prospects
of dull grey weather, land, locked in the sleep
of winter; woods, fields, waste lands, vague hills
all neutral-tinted under the grey, drifting sky.</p>

<p class='c013'>You could see the smoke rising from tiny cabins,
you could hear, now and again, the crowing of
cocks very far away, you could hear occasionally
the melancholy toot of a horn from the invisible
Shan, hunting his hares somewhere in the invisible
distance, a figure remote from actuality as a
huntsman in a dream.</p>

<p class='c013'>A weak wind blew warm from the south, stirring
the withered leaves in the hedge, and a little
bird was singing somewhere near by.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If it were all like this,” said the girl, with a
sigh, “it wouldn’t be bad.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Running away.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It will be better than this,” said he, putting
his arm round her waist.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c013'>“I wish I knew his name,” said Mr Fanshawe,
after the lapse of five minutes or so, “and I’d—pension
him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That fellow who hit Boxall on the head with
the bag of soot.”</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c013'>“It’s like a dream,” she murmured. “Do
you know, Dicky, I don’t think I was really in
love with you this morning—it has all come with
a rush—this is the <i>real</i> thing.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The only thing!” murmured Dicky, speaking
into the back of her hair.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c013'>“Is my hat straight?” asked Miss Lestrange.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Perfectly—no, let me tilt it a bit—bless it!—that’s
right—to think that it’s mine, and you
are mine, and your little boots and every bit of
you!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You, too,” she said, casting over him a loving
glance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“When it comes to the point,” he said, “I
know you’ll be brave. Believe me, it is the only
thing to do. I can get a special licence, there will
be no difficulty—Aunt Domville will arrange.
I’ll write to the Archbishop of Dublin to-day,
and his secretary can interview her; it can be done
at her house immediately we arrive. We must
give a reason for getting a special licence, and the
reason I’ll give is that I’m going abroad in a
hurry—which,” added Mr Fanshawe, with a
grin, “will be the fact, for we’ll go straight to
Nice for the honeymoon. Violet, in three days
from this you will be my wife.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But Dicky—<i>how</i> will we get away?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know, it’s like being in a trap,” said Mr
Fanshawe, “but we’ll do it. It’s the fifteen
miles to the station that will be the bother. The
express from Carlow to Dublin goes through Tullagh
station at four in the morning, it doesn’t stop
(I’ve been looking up the trains), but I’ll write
to the manager of the Great Midland of Ireland
and have it stopped, or have a special. This is
Tuesday, on Friday morning at four o’clock we’ll
be in the train—leave everything to me. Old
James, the butler, is a fool and not to be trusted,
but Patsy——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s funny,” said Miss Lestrange, “I was
just that moment thinking of Patsy, and that he
might help.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Patsy is a jewel!” said Mr Fanshawe.</p>

<p class='c013'>Violet looked at the watch on her wrist.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s after twelve,” she said. “Let’s go
back—I’m half afraid—I don’t know what he’ll
say, but luncheon is at half-past one, and we
must be a good way off. Where are we?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t know,” said Mr Fanshawe, looking
round; “we must have run in a circle or something,
for I’m all mixed up. There’s a lot of
woods over there—they may be the woods around
Glen Druid; and there’s a lot of woods over
<i>there</i>—they may be the woods round Glen Druid—bother!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which is north and which is south?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not having a compass, I can’t tell.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Can’t you tell by the sun or the wind—or
anything?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s no sun—and the wind can’t tell us
much; besides, if I knew the points of the compass
it wouldn’t be a bit of use. I believe there’s a
road down over there; let’s make for it—roads
generally lead somewhere.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They made in the direction he had pointed out.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What are you laughing at?” asked Mr
Fanshawe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I was thinking of what Mr Boxall said at
breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What was that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He said he would come with us if he wouldn’t
be in the way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Poor old Boxall! Oh, by-the-bye, that
reminds me——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t know why Boxall should have
reminded me, but—I say, you’ll promise not to
split if I tell you something?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes—go on.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, we’re going to have a burglary to-night.”
“A what—when?” asked Violet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A burglary to-night. I know it sounds
rather funny, but we’re in Ireland, you know.
Anyhow, a man is coming to steal old Lady
Molyneux’s jewels, and I’m going to catch him.
Patsy is going to let him in through his bedroom
window, and I’m going to hive him.” He
explained the <i>rationale</i> of the affair in a few words.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What fun!” cried the girl, her eyes sparkling.
“Dicky, let me see it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m afraid I can’t. You see, it’s Patsy’s
room, and late at night and all that, but you’re
pretty sure to <i>hear</i> it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d like to see it,” pouted Miss Lestrange.
“Well, promise me this—when you’ve caught
him, and tied him up, will you call me down
and let me see him?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll see,” said Dicky.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t think things like these could happen
anywhere else but in Ireland or a—dream,”
said Miss Lestrange, as he helped her through
the hedge on to the road, finishing her sentence
with her lips to his.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It seems a kind of mixture of both,” he
murmured.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s the sixteenth this morning,” said
Miss Lestrange, with a little gasp.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seventeen—eighteen—nineteen—twenty,”
counted Mr Fanshawe, “and one on the eyebrow.
Now, let’s see where we are.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A hundred yards to the right there was a
cross-road and a sign-post, which read, taking
one set of arms:</p>

<p class='c013'>[Illustration: Carlow 126 Miles]</p>

<p class='c013'>Taking the other</p>

<p class='c013'>[Illustration: ½ way to Dublin]</p>

<p class='c013'>“Half-way from where?” asked Miss Lestrange.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t know,” replied Mr Fanshawe.</p>

<p class='c013'>The wind blew amidst the thistles at the
foot of the sign-post in a cynical manner, and
the cawing of crows came from the fields.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I shouldn’t mind,” she said, “only for the
row we’re sure to get into; they’ll be waiting
luncheon. It’s bad enough our running on and
leaving him in the ditch, but that’s <i>nothing</i> to
keeping him waiting for luncheon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why the deuce need they wait?” cried Mr
Fanshawe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You don’t know what he’s like when he’s
kept waiting for his food,” said Miss Lestrange.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t I!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Listen,” she said.</p>

<p class='c013'>The noise of wheels broke the awful silence
around them, and round the bend of the road,
coming from the direction indicated as “Carlow
126 miles,” appeared the “tub.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s our salvation,” said Violet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s Patsy,” said Mr Fanshawe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ve been chasing you,” cried Doris, as
the “tub” drew up. “We saw you away up
there sitting under the hedge. We were on
the other road, then, when Patsy saw you get
up and come down the hill, he said we’d be sure
to find you here.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How many miles are we from the house,
Patsy?” asked Mr Fanshawe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Four, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If Miss Lestrange gets into the cart, can you
get her there before lunch-time?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Aisy, sir. Punch’ll do it in twenty minits.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Lestrange got into the cart.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How are you goin’, sir?” asked Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll run beside you—on you go.”</p>

<p class='c013'>At the park gates they stopped.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You go on,” said Mr Fanshawe, “I’ll turn
up in half an hour, or so—better not say you’ve
seen me at all, for we’ll get into a row for not
having gone back to help my uncle out of the
ditch.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I won’t say a word,” said Lord Gawdor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nor I,” said Doris.</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy said nothing, he only grinned.</p>

  <h2 id='ch23' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXIII <br /> <br /> THE WILD DUCKS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>General Grampound in make, shape, manner,
voice and character was exactly like the General
one meets on the stage in a farce. One meets
numerous people in the course of one’s journey
through the world who seem to have strayed
into life from a farce, and, as a rule, they are
very unpleasant people to deal with—play their
parts indifferently well, and sometimes stray out
of the world leaving a tragedy behind them.</p>

<p class='c013'>General Grampound had been winding himself
up. After his cropper in the ditch he had given
up the chase and returned home. He had been
winding himself up, but, as a matter of fact,
he did not want much winding.</p>

<p class='c013'>In this respect—and some others—the old
gentleman very much resembled Selina.</p>

<p class='c013'>During the hour before luncheon he had been
constructing set speeches with which to greet
his nephew and his ward on their return. It
was considerably to his disgust when, just before
the luncheon gong rang, the “tub” containing
Violet, the children and Patsy—all the picture
of happy innocence—drove up to the front steps.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, there you are!” cried Miss Lestrange,
glancing up at her guardian, who had opened
the hall door and was standing on the top step.
“What became of you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where’s Richard?” asked the General.
“I called to you to stop. He had no right to
go dragging you through that hedge. Where is
he?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t know,” said Violet. “I met the
governess-cart, and they gave me a lift. Did
you see the hare?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No,” said the General, glaring at the “tub”
and its occupants, “I saw no hare. Look
at that pony, all of a lather. What do you
mean by driving cattle in that fashion, sir—eh?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wasn’t dhrivin’ no cattle, sir,” replied
Patsy, who had for General Grampound a feeling
compounded in about equal parts of hatred and
fear. “Punch always lathers if you dhrive him
beyand a walk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come on, come on,” said the old gentleman,
turning to Violet, “get your hat off—get yourself
ready, the luncheon is waiting—you were late
for breakfast——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wasn’t,” said Violet; “I was down before
you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have repeatedly said,” went on the elder,
“that to make a hotel of another person’s house,
rushing out at all hours and back to meals at
all hours, is deuced bad form. I have——”</p>

<p class='c013'>The roar of the gong cut him short, and Violet
rushed upstairs to change her hat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Had a good run?” asked Uncle Molyneux
at luncheon.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Had a good what?” asked General Grampound.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Run—beagles, you know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have,” said Dicky, who had just returned,
answering the question and slipping into his
seat both at the same time, “No—chops,
please—what became of you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I met the governess-cart,” replied Violet,
“and came home in it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where’s Boxall?” asked Uncle Molyneux.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr Boxall is not feeling very well, sir, and
will not be down to luncheon,” said old James.</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy, who had given the pony in charge of
the stable lad, given his face a “lick of a towel,”
and assumed duty as distributer of mashed
potatoes, was passing along pursuing his functions
at the opposite side of the table to Mr Fanshawe.</p>

<p class='c013'>As James gave this information, Mr Fanshawe
saw the ghost of a grin pass across Patsy’s face
and vanish.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll go up and see him after luncheon,”
said the General. “I expect that tumble into
the ditch has shaken him up?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Did Mr Boxall follow the hounds?” asked
Lady Molyneux.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No; it was at the meet,” replied the General.
“A ruffian hit him on the side of the head with
a bag of soot. Egad, I thought his neck was
broken!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh,” said Lady Molyneux. She said no
more, and went on with her luncheon. It was her
first visit to Ireland. Beyond milliners’ bills,
pug dogs, three square meals a day, <i>Debrett</i>,
and the <i>Almanach de Gotha</i>, the world had little
to interest Lady Molyneux. She thought, perhaps,
that to be half stunned with a bag of soot was a
proper accompaniment to an Irish meet of the
hounds; at all events, she did not express a
contrary opinion by word or manner.</p>

<p class='c013'>After luncheon the General, having enquired
which was Mr Boxall’s room, went up and knocked
at the door.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come in,” answered a voice. “Who’s
there?”</p>

<p class='c013'>General Grampound opened the door and
entered.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Boxall was in bed. He was lying with
his face to the wall, the window blind was down;
the place had the appearance of a sick-room.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hullo!” cried the General. “What’s all
this?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I think I have the influenza,” said Mr Boxall,
without turning to answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Influenza? Why, you were all right a few
hours ago. Sure it wasn’t the blow that chap
gave you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, no,” said the Member of Parliament,
“that had nothing to do with it—only a scratch.
It’s in my bones; I felt it coming on this morning.
I oughtn’t to have gone to that confounded meet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Have a doctor?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No thanks—I say——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I want a telegram sent.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I suppose one can send a telegram in this
confounded country?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes; there’s an office in the village.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’ll find some forms in my writing-case
on the table; write it for me, like a good fellow.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Anything I can do for you, Boxall, will
give me the sincerest pleasure,” said General
Grampound, opening the writing-case. “They
are all deucedly sorry to hear of your being laid
up—enquiring after you at lunch and all that,
specially a certain young lady—hum——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Indeed!” said Mr Boxall, without emotion;
then with a sudden snarl: “I wish I could
telegraph myself out of this infernal place!
Ireland for the Irish—egad, it’s the only place
for them—den of wild beasts!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve always said myself the only thing for
Ireland was the old Duke’s—the great Duke’s
suggestion,” said General Grampound, spreading
out the telegraph form. “Sink it for half an
hour in the sea and let the beggars drown like
rats or swim to America. Here’s the telegraph
form—what’s your message?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Write,” said Mr Boxall, after a moment’s
consideration—“write, ‘Hawksley, Oxford St.,
London.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>The General did as he was directed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Got that done?” asked Mr Boxall.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now write—let me see—wait a moment—yes—write,</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Send another, same colour and size, immediately—urgent.—Richard
Boxall, Glen Druid
House, Mid Meath, Ireland.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Ireland’?” said the General. “That all?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes—quite enough. It’s about a coat—will
you see that a special messenger takes it
to the office at once?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will,” said the General, rising to go. “Can
I get you anything—some gruel or beef-tea?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No thanks—see here!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t let that fool of a red-headed boy
take the message; he’s sure to make a muddle of
it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll see to that.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“One moment,” said Mr Boxall. “You said
they were asking after me downstairs.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Rather!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Was she—um——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She was,” replied General Grampound to
this somewhat cryptic enquiry. “Seemed regularly
upset. I’m not half blind, Boxall, like
some people; I can see through a brick wall as
far as most, and I don’t want to be personal—I
don’t want to be premature—I don’t want to
pretend to know more than I ought to know,
but there’s a deuced lucky dog in this room at
present, and he’s not me, Boxall.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thanks,” said the lucky dog, shifting about
restlessly in bed. “I know you’re a good friend,
Grampound. Send that message off at once,
like a good fellow. How long does it take a
parcel to reach this place from London by post?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Parcel post or letter post?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Letter post.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, a day or two.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Send the message off at once.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile Mr Fanshawe had been writing
three important letters in the library. When
he had finished and carefully sealed them, he
placed them one on top of the other, and looked
at his watch.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dicky had almost forgotten the burglar he
was going to trap that night. The other business
consumed most of his superfluous energy and
thoughts. The readiness with which Violet
Lestrange had fallen in with his views might
have given a cold-blooded man of the world
pause, for, once a girl begins smashing conventions,
who knows where she will stop? But Mr Fanshawe,
wise in his love, felt no uneasiness on this
score; the thing that worried him was the fifteen
Irish miles between Glen Druid and Tullagh
station.</p>

<p class='c013'>The three letters he had just written would
make everything all right at the other end.
This was the hot end of the poker, and it had to
be grasped.</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy was the person who would help him to
grasp it. Patsy he felt to be a tower of strength
and ‘cuteness’, if such a simile is permissible.
And, rising from the writing-table and putting
the letters in his pocket, he went to find Patsy.
He had not far to go, for as he came into the
big hall Patsy was crossing it with a tray in hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Patsy,” said Mr Fanshawe, “when does the
post go out?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If you stick your letters in the letter-box
be the hall door, sir,” said Patsy, “it will be
cleared in half an hour. Jim Murphy takes the
letter-bag to Castle Knock.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Right!” said Mr Fanshawe. “And, see
here, I want to have a shot at the rabbits before
dark. I’m going to stroll down to the woods.
Rake out a bag to put the cartridges in, and stick
on a cap; I want you to follow me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Right, sir,” said Patsy; then, glancing round
to see that no one was listening; “I’ve got the
pulley, and the screws for it, Mr Fanshawe, and
the ould rope from the flagstaff, and all ready
for fixing.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good!” said Mr Fanshawe. “And, see
here, we’ll want help; do you know any one
who could be trusted?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Larry, the stable-man, is the chap you want,
sir; he’s as strong as an ox, and for half a crown
he’d be as dumb as a coffin board.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Very well, you can arrange with him. Now
cut off and get the bag.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He went to his room and took a Boss double-barrelled
choke bore from its case, fitted it
together, put it under his arm, put on a cap,
and joined Patsy, who was waiting in the hall
with the cartridges and the bag.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Down be the woods to the right, sir,” said
Patsy, as he trotted beside him. “If you sit be
the hedge still as a stone, they’ll be poppin’
out all around you and playin’ in the grass.”</p>

<p class='c013'>But Mr Fanshawe did not care for the prospect
of sitting still as a stone under a hedge and
potting unsuspecting rabbits playing in the grass.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s a bit of water, down beyond these
woods to the right,” said he.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There is, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll go that way—may have a chance of a
duck. See here, Patsy!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m in a bit of a fix, Patsy, and you may be
able to help.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And what’s the fix, sir?” asked Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You know the young lady you gave the
note to this morning—by the way, how did you
give it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I tried to shove it undher her door, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It wouldn’t go, so I give a knock. ‘Who’s
there?’ says she. ‘No one,’ says I; ‘it’s only
hot wather I’m bringin’ you,’ for you see, sir, the
ould missis, her ladyship, was in the next room,
and she’s not as deaf as she looks, and it’s afraid
I was, every minit, her door’d open, and she and
her ear-trumpet come out in the passidge. ‘I
have hot wather,’ says she. ‘Niver mind,’ says
I, ‘this is bether. Open the door, for the love
of God, for I can’t get it under the door, unless
I rowl it up and shove it through the keyhole.’
Wid that she opens the door a crack and shoves
her head out. ‘Who’s it from?’ she says.
‘I don’t know,’ says I; ‘it’s just a lether I found
on the stairs I thought might belong to you.’
‘Thanks,’ says she, ‘it does,’ and wid that she
shut the door, and I left her.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, see here, Patsy!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m going to marry Miss Lestrange.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Faith, and I guessed that,” said Patsy;
“and it’s I that’d be joyful to dance at your
weddin’, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There won’t be any dancing in the business,”
said Mr Fanshawe grimly. And here, strangely
enough, he was perfectly wrong, albeit the dancing
was to be of a more than fantastic character.
“You know Mr Boxall, Patsy?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Mimber of Parlymint?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes. Well, <i>he</i> wants to marry Miss Lestrange;
and the worst, of it is, Patsy, that my uncle,
General Grampound, wants him to marry her,
too.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy chuckled.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure, he’s one eye short,” said he.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That may be,” replied Mr Fanshawe, “but
Mr Boxall is very rich, and, the fact of the matter
is, I have determined to marry Miss Lestrange
without asking any one’s opinion or permission.
The fact of the matter is, I am going to run
away with her, Patsy, and marry her in Dublin;
the bother is how to get to the station without
being caught.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What o’clock was you thinkin’ of runnin’
off wid her, sir?” asked Patsy, in the most
matter-of-fact tone in the world.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The night express from Carlow goes through
Tullagh station at four o’clock in the morning.
I have written to the manager of the railway to
have it stopped on Friday morning. The question
is how are we to get from here to the station—we
can’t walk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I was thinkin’, sir, I might get the ould
trap from the inn at Castle Knock and meet
yiz at the cross-roads; but sure, if wind of it got
about, the whole county would be out to give
yiz a send-off.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That wouldn’t do,” said Mr Fanshawe.
“This isn’t a business one wants old slippers
and rice mixed up with.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, sir; and Mrs Lyburn, the lan’lady of
the inn, is’nt to be thrusted; she’s a whisperin’
gallery for lettin’ out saycrets. I’m thinkin’
the best way is to harness Fly-by-night to the
dogcart; the moon’s near the full, it’s a straight
road to Tullagh, and the divil on a dhromedary
wouldn’t catch the ould mare wanst she has the
hard high-road undher her hoofs. The only
thing, sir——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The ould Gineral’s bedroom window is over
the stable-yard.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, it is, is it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir; his window is next to Mr Boxall’s,
so it’s how to get the dogcart out of the coach-house,
and the ould mare out of the stable, and
the two hitched together and out of the yard
that’s thrublin’ me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” said Mr Fanshawe, “that’s the rub,
for if the General heard us and looked out of
the window, we’d be done for.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know, sir!” said Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We can lay down straw—straw the yard
right to the corner where you can get on the
turf. Larry Lyburn will do it between twelve
and wan o’clock in the mornin’, and you can
start be two.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Begad, Patsy’s that’s not a bad idea; they
do it in London in the streets, before houses, when
people are sick. But can Larry be trusted?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Larry’s to be thrusted wid everything but
drink, sir,” said Patsy. “He’ll straw the yard,
and harness the ould mare and all, if I give him
the word.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I’ll give him a couple of sovereigns
if he does the thing properly; you can tell him
that.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Fanshawe paused and looked around him.
They had reached the edge of a large pool with
sedgy banks; the waters of the pool reflected the
cold light of the winter sunset.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look, sir!” cried Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>A wild duck and drake were flying towards
them, across the pool. They came on, seemingly
heedless of the human beings on the bank.
Their flight seemed hurried and distressed.
Overhead they passed, and Mr Fanshawe raised
his gun. The report echoed from the woods,
and the duck and her mate passed on unscathed,
but the hawk that had been pursuing them came
whirtling from the sky, and fell on the ground
a few yards away from the marksman.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Faith, that was a fine shot,” said Patsy, as
he picked up the corpse.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There are Grampounds even amongst birds,”
muttered Dicky to himself, as he drew the unfired
cartridge and the empty case from his gun.
“Come, Patsy, I’m off back; there’s no use hanging
about after duck, for we have no dog to
retrieve them with.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let the stable chap be in your room at ten,
Patsy,” said Mr Fanshawe, as he went up the
front steps, “to help to fix up the fixings for this
burglar chap, but mind you tell him not to say
a word to any one. I’ll come down at ten to
help you—twelve o’clock the gentleman said he’d
call, didn’t he?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir,” said Patsy. “And, Mr Fanshawe!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I forgot to tell you, sir, you needn’t be
afear’d of Mr Boxall for the next few days.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How’s that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“When Bob Mahony hit him the skelp on
the head wid the sut bag, his eye popped out of
his head on the road.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“His what?—Oh, I remember——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Finders is keepers, sir,” said Patsy, with a
grin.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, good heavens—you don’t mean to
say——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve got his eye in me pocket, sir,” said
Patsy in a hoarse whisper. “He’s sint a telegram
for another wan, but till it comes he’s
tethered to his bed like a horse to a——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s enough—that’s enough,” said Mr
Fanshawe. “Here’s half a crown for you,
Patsy, for—carrying my cartridges.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, if Patsy was in Parliament instead of
Boxall,” thought Mr Fanshawe, as he went
to his room, “he’d be Prime Minister before
Boxall had learned to wash glasses and carry
dishes if he was suddenly turned into a page-boy
like Patsy. Patsy, if he did nothing else, would
be pretty sure to catch the Speaker’s eye. We’ll
take Patsy with us, begad, when we levant.
Patsy is far, far too valuable an article to be
left wasting his fragrance here. With Violet
as a wife, and Patsy as a servant, a man ought
to go to the top of the apple tree. Decidedly
I’m in luck.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He was in the act of lighting a cigarette when
a tap came to the door, followed by little Lord
Gawdor’s voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr Fanshawe!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hullo!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’re decoratin’ the nursery for Christmas;
come and help.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Like a rocket!” replied Dicky; “I’ll be
there in two minutes, when I’ve finished this
cigarette.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch24' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXIV <br /> <br /> NAILING UP THE HOLLY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>There is nothing an old-time woman enjoyed
so much as having her mind made up for her—by
a man—some women do still.</p>

<p class='c013'>This faculty varies in proportion to the
“strength of mind” of the woman. It was
the fainting, ballad-singing, salt-snuffing girl
who, in the old days, did the desperate things;
and the reason why the roads are not strewn
nowadays with post-chaises <i>en route</i> to Gretna
Green, is partly because Gretna Green and post-chaises
have vanished, partly because girls have
changed.</p>

<p class='c013'>They have become stronger-minded; they no
longer run away, they advance. But here and
there you will find a girl, a modification of the
old type—a girl who seems to have strayed out of
some old rose garden, a girl who would not look
foolish playing a harp, a girl one might serenade
without the fear of covering oneself with ridicule,
or being covered by the contents of a slop-jar.</p>

<p class='c013'>Violet Lestrange was a girl of this type;
sweet without being foolish, simple-minded, but
not an idiot, capable of screaming mechanically
at the sight of a mouse, and of facing a lion in
cold blood to protect the man she loved.</p>

<p class='c013'>She was the last person in the world to be
suspected of making a run away match with the
man of her choice, and the first person in the
world to do it.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is a much easier matter to draw the pen
portrait of a Mr Mahony than of a Violet Lestrange.
Dark, with violet eyes and a beautiful
complexion, she had that lost touch of beauty
only to be found, I think, and that very rarely,
amongst the women of Ireland; a faint permanent
blush over the cheek bones, like the reflection on
alabaster of a June rose.</p>

<p class='c013'>One might have thought that when General
Grampound chose a future husband for all this
beauty, he might at least have chosen a man
with two eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>Whilst Mr Fanshawe was shooting by the little
lake, the unfortunate Violet was dispensing
afternoon tea. She had made up her mind and
given her word that morning when seated under
the hedge. Ever since, she had been rocking
upon a sea whose alternate billows seemed
compounded of Bliss and Fright.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the fright was upon her, the sight of
Lady Molyneux calmly munching her muffins
seemed awful; General Grampound stirring his
tea was tragic, as the figure of a man whom she
had betrayed and murdered; Uncle Molyneux
and his eye-glass seemed the incarnation of
saintly propriety; and the “Violet, dear, another
cup of tea, without quite so much milk,” of
Lady Seagrave, the last word of pathos, and a
thing to make one weep.</p>

<p class='c013'>All these people were about to be betrayed.
They all seemed either so foolish or so old, all
so unsuspecting.</p>

<p class='c013'>That they were, in fact, a company of robbers
of the worst description, banded together with
the object of stealing her happiness and
ruining her life, never for a moment occurred to
her.</p>

<p class='c013'>She pitied them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then, rocked suddenly on a billow of bliss,
pity and fear vanished utterly; Dicky Fanshawe
entered her mind, and she put two lumps of
sugar instead of two tabloids of saccharine in
General Grampound’s cup, and scarcely heard
the explosion.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Miss Lestrange!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Violet was crossing the hall after the tea
ordeal; she looked up. A pasty little face
was looking over the banisters. It was Lord
Gawdor’s.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’re decorating the nursery for Christmas;
come’n help.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Lestrange came up the stairs, and little
Lord Gawdor seized her in a loving embrace
with his arm half round her waist. Like this
they marched along, up another flight of stairs
and down the corridor to the nursery.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They’re putting two shillings’ worth of thripenny
pieces in the pudding,” said Lord Gawdor.
“I’ve had a stir at it—have you had a stir at
it? It’s only eight days to Christmas—I’m
to have a watch—a gold one—with a minute
hand, but you’re not to tell, for it’s to be a surprise.
Don’t you hope it’ll snow on Christmas
Day?—I expect you’ll have lots of presents, too.
Shall I tell you a secret?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not if you oughtn’t to tell.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, it doesn’t matter, if you keep it. Granny
is going to give you——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t!” said Miss Lestrange, feeling as
though she could weep at the thought of the
innocent Christmas festivities, and the present
being prepared for her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s a grebe muff and a prayer-book,”
said Lord Gawdor, hurriedly unlading his
secret.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh!” said she, losing all sense of pathos in
the shock of this information.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But you’re not to tell,” said Lord Gawdor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I won’t,” said she. “Listen—who is that?”
They had neared the nursery door, which was
a bit open.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s Mr Fanshawe; he’s helping to nail
up the holly.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Violet paused at the door and peeped in.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Fanshawe, in his shirt sleeves, was standing
on a step-ladder, hammer in hand, vigorously
at work. Doris and Selina were helping.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Pass me up the nails,” cried Mr Fanshawe.
“Nails, not tin tacks, addle-head! One, two,
three—that’ll keep it fixed. Selina won’t give
up the ball of twine, won’t she? I’ll attend to
her in a minute.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They all seemed so happy and busy that a
mist came over Miss Lestrange’s eyes. All fear
of the future suddenly cleared from her mind.
Dicky, in his shirt sleeves, nailing up holly, was
pre-eminently the figure of a man to whom one
might trust oneself and one’s future.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hullo!” said Mr Fanshawe, turning and
beaming upon the newcomers. “You’re too
late—everything is done, and there’s nothing
to nail up, unless we nail up Selina.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Selina protested vigorously, and Miss Lestrange,
taking her in her lap, sat down in the rocking-chair
by the fire.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s the bunch of mistletoe,” said Lord
Gawdor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So there is,” said Mr Fanshawe. “Hand
it up here and I’ll nail it out of mischief.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I saw Uncle Molyneux kissing Kate under
the mistletoe last Christmas,” said Lord Gawdor.
“It was in the dining-room, and there was no
one there; she squealed and ran round the table,
and he ran after her and caught her round the
waist, and gave her a kiss on the cheek that
sounded like a cracker.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who was Kate?” asked Miss Lestrange.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The housemaid,” replied Lord Gawdor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“She had a face just like an apple,” said
Doris. “Another nail, Mr Fanshawe?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All shiny, you know,” said Lord Gawdor.
“Like an apple when you spit on it and polish it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>These momentous disclosures were scarcely
heard by Mr Fanshawe and Miss Lestrange, who
were engaged in their own thoughts and a veiled
attempt at communication.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve fixed it all up,” said Dicky, nailing
away at the mistletoe. “Wrote three letters—one
to Aunt Domville.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d love to meet her!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You will soon—one to the manager of the
railway——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Any more nails, Mr Fanshawe?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, give me the whole box—that’s right—and
one to the Archbishop.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Prenez garde</i>,” said Miss Lestrange.</p>

<p class='c013'>“One to the Archbishop asking how his aunt
was; she’s had influenza. Then I went out to
shoot rabbits with Patsy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Did you get any?” asked Lord Gawdor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No. I saw two ducks—that is to say, a
duck and a drake; they were running away
together—flying away, I mean—they were being
pursued by their uncle.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ducks haven’t uncles,” said Lord Gawdor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He was a hawk,” said Mr Fanshawe. “With
Patsy’s help I shot the hawk, and the ducks
flew away, and were happy ever after.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How interesting!” said Miss Lestrange.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Funny thing, the same thing happened one
morning before Christmas. It was a Friday
morning—what’s to-day—Tuesday—well, it was
a Friday morning. It might have been next
Friday morning, as the old women say, I saw
two ducks flying away pursued by a hawk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Did they escape?” asked Doris.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They did.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How did you see them, Mr Fanshawe?”
asked Lord Gawdor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“With my eyes,” replied Mr Fanshawe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But it’s black dark at four.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There was a moon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s the dressing gong,” said Violet,
rising, and putting Selina down on the hearthrug,
as the roar of the gong came from below.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And I’ve finished the decorations,” said Mr
Fanshawe, coming down the ladder.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr Fanshawe,” said Doris, “you’ve used
nearly the whole box of nails, nailing up that
piece of mistletoe.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We can’t play the nursery game any longer,”
said Mr Fanshawe, as they came down the passage
together, “or people will suspect; not that I
expected to meet you there just now. I just
went to help the kids with the holly; Bob came
and asked me. But I don’t know how we’re
to see each other again to-night, unless in the
drawing-room, and that’s worse than nothing.
I’ve got to bottle this beastly burglar at ten—at
least fix up the contraption to catch him in.
He’s coming at twelve.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, Dicky, I’d forgot——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That burglar—how wicked of me! I’ve
been so happy and so frightened that I’ve been
able to think of nothing. Will it be dangerous?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not a bit. I’ve got the stable-man and
Patsy to help.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I shan’t sleep till it’s all over.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll give two knocks at your door when it’s
all fixed. You understand what I meant about
the ducks—everything is arranged for Friday
morning. Isn’t it frightful that we can only
speak to one another by strategy like this?
No matter, it won’t be long now——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s a meet of the hounds to-morrow
morning,” said Violet. “We may be able to
talk then without being observed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes; O’Farrell’s hounds are going to meet
on the lawn here at ten.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hi you, sir—why don’t you bring me my
hot water?” came General Grampound’s voice
from below.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s the hawk,” whispered Dicky.</p>

<p class='c013'>Violet shivered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Suppose——” she said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Suppose you hadn’t shot that—other hawk!”
she murmured.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It would have been all up with the ducks,”
he said, “or one of them.”</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c013'>“Bob!” said Doris.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What!” asked Bob.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you know what I believe?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I believe Miss Lestrange is going to marry
Mr Fanshawe without any one knowing.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the matter if she does?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I heard him say something last night, when
he had Selina on his lap and we were playing
with the motor-car, about an Archbishop and
a marriage licence, and that nobody need know;
and, just now, when he said he’d written to the
Archbishop, did you hear what she said?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She said <i>prenez garde</i>, just as granny does if
she’s speaking about anything she doesn’t want
us to know. Then he said he’d written to the
Archbishop’s aunt, or some nonsense.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I heard him say that,” said Bob.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I believe they’re going to get married,”
went on Doris, “but don’t tell any one.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who’s going to—it’s only girls tell things—I’m
not going to tell. Come on, and let’s look
at ’em going into dinner.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch25' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXV <br /> <br /> A POTENTIAL POET</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>The stable of an Irish country house has always,
or nearly always, a certain number of volunteer
and unpaid on-hangers. At any hour of the
day you might have seen in the stable-yard
of Glen Druid Billy the Buck chewing a straw,
Shan Finucane with his hands in his pockets,
and his back against the harness room door,
Moriarty, the rat-catcher from Castle Connell,
colloguing, rat cage in hand, with the scullery-maid,
or Micky Mooney sitting on a corn-bin,
whistling and kicking his heels.</p>

<p class='c013'>Micky was “soft.” He lived with his mother
in the village of Castle Knock; and every morning
early she would turn him out of her cabin, just
as a person turns a donkey out to graze.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was almost entirely self-supporting. In
summer he would disappear for days amidst
the hills, communing with nature and existing
on roots and whortle berries and wild strawberries.
If Micky sat down in a field full of
rabbits, the rabbits would play about him within
arm’s reach; birds knew him for their friend,
cows let him milk them into his hat without
protest or lamentation, and hens gave up their
eggs without complaint, when raised from their
nests by his deft fingers.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was of all mad creatures the most harmless
and the most natural—a really beautiful
character; one of that rare type wherein lunacy
is the outcome of innocence carried to an extreme.
Farmers threatened to shoot him, it is true,
and he had actually been fired at, and peppered
with small shot when engaged in stealing eggs,
but this was not done from any particular ill-will.
The farmer had acted just as he acted towards the
thrushes and blackbirds that pilfered his crops.</p>

<p class='c013'>Micky was, in fact, regarded by the general
public as being on a level with the birds and the
rabbits, and, though no one would have hurt
him for any consideration, still, had some outraged
farmer shot him with a bullet in earnest,
I doubt if there would have been much of an
inquest.</p>

<p class='c013'>This personage who had hunted the moon
on many a summer’s night, had amongst other
attributes the power of seeing fairies; nor was
he in the least afraid of them. You would
see him lifting up dock-leaves, and conversing
with the people who lived below. He could
tell half-connected tales of his doings with these
folk, talking with his face half turned from you,
and tracing with his thumb nail the extent of
a crack in the fence he was leaning against, or
the pattern of the door panel he was near; and
he would tell you this and that, and the other
thing, till all of a sudden his imagination would
become too much for him, and with a whoop!
off he would go vaulting the fence, and away
across country like an india-rubber ball or a
bounding kangaroo, to tell the rest of his tale to
the rabbits.</p>

<p class='c013'>Just a grain more phosphorous, just a grain
more ballast, and Micky Mooney might have
been a poet of the Celtic school, and led a revival
and written books.</p>

<p class='c013'>As it was, he had some of the poetic influence
that makes for better things; in his company
men tended to forget horses, dogs, rat-catching,
whisky and girls, and turn their conversation
to banshees, cluricaunes, cats with horns on
their heads, and other topics of a similar
nature.</p>

<p class='c013'>When Mr Fanshawe had parted from Patsy
at the front door, the latter, turning his steps
to the stable-yard, had found Micky Mooney
seated on the bottom of a bucket, listening
with open mouth to Moriarty, the rat-catcher,
who was discoursing on psychical subjects, whilst
Larry Lyburn stood by the harness room door
cleaning a stirrup, listening also, or seeming to
listen.</p>

<p class='c013'>All the time Moriarty had been talking, Micky
Mooney had been working himself up, clapping
the palms of his hands on his knees, twisting
his mouth about and flinging his head from side
to side. No sooner had Moriarty finished than
he burst forth.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know a lady aal dressed in white—I know
a lady aal dressed in white,” began Micky, rocking
himself on the bucket and staring with his big
eyes through Patsy and a hundred miles beyond—“aal
dressed in white, wid a crown of gowld;
and it’s ‘Micky, come afther me,’ she says, whin
I meets her in the woods, ‘and it’s crocks and
crates of gowld I’ll be showin’ you,’ she says.
And it’s to-night I’m to meet her down in the
woods be the Druids’ althar—aal dressed in
white, wid a——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Arra! shut your head and get off the bucket,”
said Mr Lyburn, who had finished cleaning the
stirrup, and was now proceeding to water the
horses, punctuating his remark with the toe of
his boot on that part of Micky’s anatomy that
was closest to the bucket.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Lyburn was not a poet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Micky,” said Patsy, into whose arms the
moon-struck one had been shot, “stop your
nise and hould your bellowin’, and come afther
me, for I’ve got a job for you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He led the seer of visions by the left hand
(the right was applied to the punctuation mark)
round the angle of the stable wall to a quiet spot
near the potato room window.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hould your nise,” said Patsy, “and be
listenin’ to me; I’ve got a job for you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is it a saft job?” blubbered Micky, who
with a grain more brass and a grain more ballast
in his composition would have shone perhaps as a
Labour Member or a Labour Leader.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Saft as a feather-bed,” replied Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then the two began to converse together in a
low tone.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now Patsy’s hatred of Mr Boxall had roots far
beyond the present, roots from the time when
some men played on harps and other men painted
themselves with woad.</p>

<p class='c013'>The spirit of Puck that dwelt in the breast
of Patsy had been brooding on the form of Micky
Mooney all the time that Moriarty had been
telling of the cluricaune. Micky’s statement
about the lady in white had given the tricky
spirit an idea.</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy did not require Mr Fanshawe’s word
to know that Mr Boxall was “gone” on Miss
Lestrange, and this knowledge was part parent
of the idea.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And what will you be givin’ me if I be afther
doin’ as you tells me?” queried Micky, plucking
at the moss in the cracks of the wall.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll give you the first silver sixpence with
a hole in it I finds on a Tuesday.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which Cheusday?” asked Micky cautiously,
with a side look at his employer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll be tellin’ you that to-morra. Will you
be doin’ what I say?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will,” said Micky.</p>

  <h2 id='ch26' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXVI <br /> <br /> THE SPIRIT OF IRELAND</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>When General Grampound took his leave of
Mr Boxall, Mr Boxall rose from his bed and
resumed those garments he had relinquished
before taking his place between the sheets.
Having nothing else to do, and to kill the time,
he took his place at the writing-table near the
window, and proceeded to write letters.</p>

<p class='c013'>The window gave a view over the stable roofs
of a country more beautiful than a picture.
The park, and the pools, heron-haunted, and
lying under the grey sky of winter, made a picture
tenderly tinted as an aquarelle; the fields, the
woods, the moorlands, the dim and distant hills
of Glynn, how beautiful they were seen through
that illusive atmosphere, the air of Ireland!</p>

<p class='c013'>The air of Ireland, the moist and crystal-clear
air, what a magician it is! what a wealth of illusion
it holds, and voiceless poetry!</p>

<p class='c013'>Till you have known its influence, you never
can know how far-off hills can draw you towards
them, or what voices can haunt the glens. When
you have known its influence you will know
more of that mysterious secret “Ireland” than
all the gaol reports, agricultural reports and Blue
Books can teach you—if you are a poet.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Boxall was not a poet. He had come
over to Ireland for two reasons, firstly, to be
in the same house with Violet Lestrange; secondly,
to study Ireland and the Irish. He was not a
poet, but a practical man.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now, the pursuit of Love is as dangerous a
pursuit for a practical man as the study of the
Irish in their own home.</p>

<p class='c013'>Love hates practical people, so does the spirit
of Ireland. The spirit of Ireland had given
Mr Boxall a bang on the head with a soot bag,
and Love had locked him up in his room; and,
being a practical man without a grain of humour
in his mass, he could not see the joke, or take the
hint.</p>

<p class='c013'>Take the hint—ah! what a lot of philosophy
lies in those three words! Watch a French
punter at Monte Carlo: fortune declares against
him, and he takes the hint and stops; your stolid
Englishman does not even see the hint: he takes
it as a personal insult, goes on, and gets broken.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Boxall did not even see the hint, and,
here, let me point out to the unintelligent reader
that, perhaps symbolism rather than low comedy
is served by the presence—and sometimes absence—of
Mr Boxall’s glass eye in this book.</p>

<p class='c013'>Whilst he was finishing his letters, he could
hear an indistinct murmuring of voices from the
stable-yard below. It was Moriarty discoursing
on cluricaunes. He heard the yell emitted by
Micky Mooney on being kicked off the bucket by
Larry Lyburn, and the subsequent bellowings
and blubberings of that seer. He would have
put his head out of the window to enquire the
meaning of it, but for ocular reasons.</p>

<p class='c013'>“D—d savages!” said Mr Boxall. He had
placed a muffler round his neck for the sake of
appearances, should any other member of the
household call upon him to enquire after his
health. No one came, however. Uncle Molyneux
had too much dread of influenza, and, as for
Dicky Fanshawe, he was busy in other directions.</p>

<p class='c013'>At five o’clock a servant brought up tea, which
was placed, by direction of the power inside,
on the mat before the bedroom door. When
the servant had withdrawn, the invalid, opening
the door cautiously, fetched in the tray.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Boxall did not keep a man. Though
he had several thousand a year and a tin mine,
he was a careful person, who turned a penny
twice over before he parted with it, and then,
as often as not, put it back in his pocket; yet,
though miserly in small things, he gave considerably
to well-organised charities, and he had been
known to commit quite unexpected and kindly
acts.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was in fact, an excellent citizen, but he
was a man utterly without a sense of humour,
the poetry of life was for him not; and, though
he had been known to utter noises indicative
of mirth at parliamentary dinners, Laughter, that
happy sprite, never sat upon his lips.</p>

<p class='c013'>One might imagine stiff and starched individuals
of this description incapable of romantic attachment;
unfortunately they are not. They enter
the lists of love, and they go to the encounter
heavily armed.</p>

<p class='c013'>A man who is able to hurl a tin mine at your
head is not to be despised. Adonis himself
would stand a poor chance nowadays against
a man armed with great blocks of London North
Western and other railway shares.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fight between the Boxalls and the Fanshawes
of Society is a pretty equal encounter,
even though the Fanshawes are fairly well provided
with earthly goods.</p>

<p class='c013'>As Mr Boxall was finishing his lonely tea, a
knock came to the door, followed by a voice
through the keyhole.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Misther Boxall,” said the voice, “are yiz
there? The young lady’s wishful to see you;
be on the laan in front of the house be half-past
tin o’clock, sharp.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, yes,” said Mr Boxall. “Who is there—what’s
that’s you say?”</p>

<p class='c013'>No answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who is there?”</p>

<p class='c013'>No answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Boxall went to the door, opened it cautiously
two inches or so and peeped out; there was no
one visible. He opened it fully and put his head
out: the corridor was empty. Then he closed
the door, and pacing his room ruminated over
the message he had just received.</p>

<p class='c013'>The only young lady in the house was Violet
Lestrange; that the message referred to her
he could not doubt, that the message had come
to him from the lips of a servant was undeniable.
The sex of the servant he could not tell, for the
voice was muted, yet it sounded female.</p>

<p class='c013'>If you were to imagine that the message gave
him any thrill, or caused him any pleasurable
excitement, you would be vastly mistaken.</p>

<p class='c013'>He felt very much irritated. The whole thing
was out of order, and utterly inexplicable. He
had chosen Violet Lestrange to act in the capacity
of his future wife, firstly, because she was of
good family, and was not of the flighty order
of women; secondly, because her great beauty
appealed to the man in him.</p>

<p class='c013'>By no word or act up to this had she shaken
his high opinion of her, and now from the mouth
of a servant came this extraordinary invitation
to meet her on the lawn at half-past ten.</p>

<p class='c013'>Besides, she knew that he had the influenza,
and, knowing that, she had asked him to leave
his bed and meet her at this untimely hour.
This aggrieved him almost as much as the “fastness”
of the proposition.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then the horrible thought came to him—can
she know the real reason? He dismissed
this at once. Besides, she would hardly call
him out on the lawn late at night to commiserate
with him on the loss of an eye, especially considering
the nature of the eye, and the manner of
its losing.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the foundation of his nature was a very
snappish and nasty temper, easily aroused and
brought to the surface by little things. This
had to snap and snarl and have its say before
pure reason could take the situation and deal
with it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now,” said Pure Reason at last, “there is
more in this than meets the eye. Of course,
she does not want to see me for any reason
connected—ahum—with our mutual esteem.
She is a lady: she is not the class of girl to compromise
herself. No matter how much she cares
for me, she is the last person in the world to
make a false move, unless sudden insanity can
have seized her: She has some powerful motive
for this, some very urgent reason.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He lay down on his bed again revolving matters
in his mind, and presently General Grampound
knocked at his door and came in to make enquiries
and propositions about dinner.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let them send me up a little chicken,”
said the sufferer, “or anything light—no champagne,
thanks. I have put this bandage on to
relieve the pain. Thank you, I am better.
I do not believe in drugs.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The tea-things were removed, and the dinner
was brought up by Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Put it on the table, and don’t disturb those
papers,” said Mr Boxall, who was seated in an
armchair with a bandage over the side of his
head. “Not on the papers—have you no
sense?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir,” said Patsy. “Can I be afther
fetchin’ you anything more, sir?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No; come up in half an hour for the tray.”</p>

<p class='c013'>At ten o’clock Mr Boxall had made up his
mind. The hall was generally deserted at night;
he would come downstairs, cross the hall, and
leave the house by the front door. If any one
saw him, he could say that he was going on the
lawn for a breath of fresh air.</p>

<p class='c013'>The bandage across his forehead he retained,
and it, half covered by a forage cap, gave him
somewhat the appearance of a hospital out-patient
as, muffled in an overcoat, he descended the stairs
at half-past ten and crossed the hall to the front
door. The door was only held by the catch;
Mr Boxall opened it, passed out, and closed it
softly behind.</p>

<p class='c013'>Less than five minutes later old James, whose
duty it was to see things settled for the night,
put the chain on the front door and drew the
heavy bolts.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch27' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXVII <br /> <br /> MIDWINTER NIGHT’S DREAM</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>It was a beautiful night, lit by the rising moon
and a million stars. Mild almost as a night
in summer, voiceless as the tomb, cloudless and
perfect. The great stars, winter-clear, burned
right down to the roof of the woods, and amidst
the trees the moonlight made Fairyland of the
glades. Listening, one could hear occasionally
the cry of an owl, and occasionally, a great way
off, from the neighbourhood of the Galtee woods,
the bark of a fox.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Boxall descended the steps and glanced
around; it was a few minutes past half-past
ten, but there was no trace or sign of Miss
Lestrange. A chill came to his heart: the
monstrous idea, “Can I have been fooled?”
crossed his mind, and was banished. He stepped
from the gravelled drive to the grass and stood
for a moment inhaling the balmy air and looking
around him.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the middle of the lawn there was a great old
sundial supported by a group of fauns and satyrs,
moss-grown and mysterious. Mr Boxall’s eye
fell on this thing, and just at that moment, over
the top of the sundial, appeared a face. It was
not the face of Miss Lestrange, it was a round
and tallow-white face—the face, in fact, of Micky
Mooney.</p>

<p class='c013'>Micky beckoned, and Mr Boxall drew close
till he got within touching distance of the
sundial.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Are yiz Misther Oxhall?” asked Micky in
a low and confidential voice, plucking at the
moss on the sundial as he spoke, and seeming
to address it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am,” said Mr Boxall, recognising his name
in the inversion. “What’s all this—where is
the lady?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Beyant there in the trees,” said Micky,
detaching himself from the sundial and making
off in the direction of the trees, followed by
the other. “I’m to show her to yiz, if y’ll be
afther follyin’ me; says he to me, says he, ‘Wait
be the sundile till the big clock lets one bang out
of it afther it’s sthruck tin, and y’ll see a gintleman
wid a big white face,’ says he, ‘and you lade
him to see the lady,’ he says, ‘or it’s a kick I’ll
be givin’ you, same as Larry Lyburn, instid of
a sixpence wid a howl in it,’ he says.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who says?” asked Mr Boxall, in high
dudgeon. “What are you talking about? Who
told you to wait for me?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure, that would be tellin’,” said Micky,
who was trotting by the other’s side, gambolling
with his shadow in the moonlight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Boxall tramped on in silence, utterly
exasperated and confounded. The gambols of
the half-witted creature beside him might have
given him a hint that something was wrong
in the affair. But he was determined to see the
thing through.</p>

<p class='c013'>They crossed the parkland and entered the
wood. The moonlight falling between the leafless
branches on the withered ferns made a picture
wonderfully beautiful and weird.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, which way? Go on—what are you
stopping for?” said Mr Boxall, as his guide
halted and held up a finger.</p>

<p class='c013'>An owl crying in the depths of the trees had
been answered by its mate.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Listen to the cucks crowin’!” said Micky.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Damn the cocks!” cried Mr Boxall. “Go
on—where is the lady?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I dinno,” said Micky; “but if yiz’l listen
yiz’l hear her vice, and it’s ‘Micky, come afther
me,’ she always does be cryin’. Aal dressed in
white she is, wid a crown of gowld on her head,
and it’s ‘Micky, come afther me,’ she does be
cryin’. Whisht!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, dash it—it’s a lunatic!” cried Mr
Boxall.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whisht!” said Micky, bending down, resting
his hands on his knees and presenting an ear
towards the ground, “I hear her fut.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The next moment he had vanished from the
scene. It was just as if Mr Boxall had kicked
him into space.</p>

<p class='c013'>“D—d lunatic!” said Mr Boxall, nursing
his foot.</p>

<p class='c013'>He made his way out from amidst the trees;
as he left their shelter the solemn tones of the
house clock striking eleven came floating across
the park. From the woods the far-away whooping
and shouting of the visionary, still impelled
and still running, came like a voice heard in
dreamland.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch28' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXVIII <br /> <br /> MR LYBURN</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Larry Lyburn had a face which, in colour and
expression, was exactly like a wedge of double
Gloucester cheese. He was the helper in the
stable, and lived over the horses. Dan, the coachman,
had a cottage near the gamekeeper’s.</p>

<p class='c013'>Larry had champagne-bottle shoulders, rather
bowed legs, and a back like the hind view of a
lobster. He was a decent-living man, a superb
horseman, an excellent groom, and a heaven-born
vet. He was nothing else. If his character
had been cut out of cardboard the line of demarcation
between living efficiency and dead blankness
could not have been more sharply defined.
Larry was not only entirely and utterly destitute
of all—even the most rudimentary—knowledge
of Politics, Astronomy, Art, Literature (including
writing and spelling) and Geography, but he was
destitute also of the power of acquiring such
knowledge, or the wish to do so. He was a
living example of what horses can do for a man
if he devotes himself to them properly, and to
nothing else.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tell him to do a stable job, and everything
would be done well and up to time, but send
him on the simplest business into the outside
world beyond the smell of ammonia, and everything
would be muddled. He would have made
a splendid ambassador to the Huhyhnms, but
for anything else in the universe beyond his
work he was worthless.</p>

<p class='c013'>This was Larry, sober. “Once in a while,”
Larry got drunk. That is a plain statement of
the fact. The whisky flew to his head, and one may
amuse oneself with imagining the consternation
of the whisky fiend on finding itself in such a
skull. The man could not be made speechless,
because he was always speechless; nor talkative,
because he had nothing to talk about.
He could not be made to blunder worse in the
ordinary affairs of life.</p>

<p class='c013'>On these occasions Larry made mistakes in
his work, but it is only fair to him to say they
were very rare occasions.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was standing in the harness room cleaning
a bit with sand by the light of a lantern, when
Patsy appeared to summon him to help in fixing
up the burglar trap.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Larry,” said Patsy, sticking his head in
through the half-open door. “Oh, there you
are. Mr Fanshawe wants you in the house.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m finishin’ clanin’ me harness,” replied
Larry. (Mr Lyburn always spoke of the harness
as his personal property, also of the horses.)</p>

<p class='c013'>“How much more of it have you to clane?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothin’.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, finish it up in a hurry,” said Patsy,
“for he’s waitin’ till you come.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get off that chist!” cried Larry, polishing
away at the bit, as Patsy made to take his seat
on a big corn-bin whose lid did duty for a table.
“Get off that chist, or I’ll land you a wan wid
me fut.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy got off the chest.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Lyburn was very touchy about a lot of
things, and he expressed himself directly; it
was part of the cardboard nature of the individual:
he had no <i>nuances</i> of expression.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had cleaned the bit with sand, he was
now polishing it with a chamois-leather and
loving tenderness. If Larry was a living example
of what horses can do for a man, the harness
room was an object-lesson of what a man can do for
harness. It was good to look at the glossy,
nut-brown, pig-skin saddles on their rests, the
suits of carriage harness, each complete and
in its proper place.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lave down that whip, or I’ll be takin’ the
butt of it to you!” cried Larry.</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy put the whip aside and waited, making
no attempt at conversation, which he knew
would be useless.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the bit was polished to satisfaction
and placed aside, Larry looked around to see
that everything was in its place, blew out the
stable lantern, closed the door, and prepared
to follow Patsy into the house.</p>

<p class='c013'>It will be noticed that he did not enquire of
Patsy what business Mr Fanshawe wanted him
upon.</p>

<p class='c013'>Led by Patsy, he entered the house by the
kitchen entrance.</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy’s room, as we have said, was on the
ground-floor. The other servants’ rooms were
at the top of the house, but the page-boy at
Glen Druid always inhabited a room on the
ground-floor, near the plate pantry.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was five minutes past ten; most of the
servants had gone up to bed, and nobody saw
them as they went down the passage to the
room, where, lit by a candle burning on the
chest of drawers, a coil of rope, a huge pulley,
some carpenter’s tools, and half a dozen long
screws lay on the bed. A step-ladder stood in the
middle of the room under the beam in the ceiling.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You wait here,” said Patsy, “till I tell
Mr Fanshawe. Don’t be movin’ from the room;
and if any one comes, say you’ve come to help
fix the window sash.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Off with you!” replied Larry.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lady Seagrave, Uncle Molyneux, Violet
Lestrange and General Grampound were playing
bridge in the drawing-room when Patsy appeared
with the announcement, that Larry Lyburn
wanted to see Mr Fanshawe on account of one
of the horses.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dicky, who had excused himself from bridge,
alleging a headache, left the room with a glance
at Violet—an ocular kiss unnoticed by the
others in the ferment of mind caused by the
General, who was going the grand slam.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Larry’s waitin’, sir,” said Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come on,” replied Mr Fanshawe.</p>

<p class='c013'>They reached the room unnoticed, and Larry
greeted Mr Fanshawe with a touch of an imaginary
hat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s right,” said Dicky, looking at the
things on the bed—“everything is here. Does
Larry know what we’re about?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, sir,” said Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, see here,” said Mr Fanshawe, turning
to the stable-man, “a burglar is going to break
into the house to-night, and I’m going to catch
him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Fanshawe made the statement, as we make
many statements in this life, little knowing how
much it implied, for, as a matter of fact, the
thing he was about to catch or lose that night
was not so much Paddy Murphy as his future
happiness.</p>

<p class='c013'>How Mr Murphy could possibly be bound up
with that blissful condition you will not discover,
however, till you have read the last pages of this
story.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sor,” said Larry, as unmoved as though
it were some minor stable matter about which
Mr Fanshawe had spoken.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I want you to help.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You see that rope?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m going to screw that pulley on to the
beam.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll put the rope through the pulley and
a running noose at the end of the rope.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sor. Axing your pardon, sor, I don’t
mind helpin’ in the fixin’ and the bindin’ of him,
but I’d rather lave the stretchin’ of him to you,
sor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The what?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The stretchin’, sor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The hangin’ he means, sir,” said Patsy.
“Sure, Larry, that’s not what Misther Fanshawe’s
afther.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good God!” said Dicky, “you didn’t
think I was going to <i>hang</i> the man!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Larry scratched his head.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I thought be the rope, sor——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come on,” said Mr Fanshawe, “and I’ll
show you what I mean.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He got on the step-ladder and fixed the pulley
tight on to the beam with long screws. At one
end of the rope, he made a huge running noose,
large enough for the body of a man to pass
through, then he pulled up the window sash
and tacked the upper part of the noose to the
lower part of the sash lightly with tin tacks,
so that a strong pull would fetch the whole
thing away. He passed the free end of the rope
through the pulley. A man entering the window
would pass through the noose.</p>

<p class='c013'>“See!” said Mr Fanshawe. “We will leave
the window just like that; it’s a warm night
outside.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s now eleven,” said Mr Fanshawe, “and
we have an hour to wait. Patsy will stand by
the window, I’ll sit on the bed with this end of
the rope in my hand, you sit beside me. When
I give the word, and not before, haul for all
you’re worth; it will take the two of us to swing
him up. Patsy, take the step-ladder away. I
shall go and have a whisky and soda, and be
back in twenty minutes. You stay here, Larry.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sor.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch29' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXIX <br /> <br /> THE TRAP</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>The moon, nearing the full, was high over the
hills, but its light did not enter Patsy’s room,
which was in almost black darkness.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sitting on the bed, Mr Fanshawe could see
the window, a square of vague light. But for
a faint perfume of stables, he would not have
known that Mr Lyburn was seated on the bed
beside him, so silent and motionless was that
individual.</p>

<p class='c013'>Suddenly “Boom! boom!”—the great clock
in the turret began striking twelve. The echo
of the last stroke died away, and the awful
silence returned.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Fanshawe began to fidget.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They ought to be here soon now,” he said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sor,” replied a voice at his elbow.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You aren’t frightened, are you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, sor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You can feel the rope all right?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mind, when I give the word, you pull for
all you’re worth.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“For,” said Mr Fanshawe, “if we don’t
secure the bounder, he’ll most likely knife us.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Patsy!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Misther Fanshawe?” came a voice
from beside the window.</p>

<p class='c013'>“When his shoulders are through, mind and
yell out ‘Right.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You lave that to me, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Five minutes passed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hounds meet here at ten to-morrow,” said
Mr Fanshawe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Fanshawe moistened his lips. The awful
composure of Mr Lyburn impressed him with an
eerie sensation. The man did not seem to
breathe or move; it was like being seated beside
a statue. The smell of stable that came in waves,
now faint, now more powerful, the mechanical
voice, were beginning to tell on his nerves.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c013'>And here, whilst Mr Fanshawe waits, let me
interpolate a few lines.</p>

<p class='c013'>When Mr Boxall left the shade of the trees
and emerged into the full moonlight, the clock
of Glen Druid House was striking eleven.
Beneath the anger boiling in his soul lay the
deep satisfaction a man experiences when he
has kicked his antithesis. He made his way
across the park-land and lawn, and, on tiptoe,
crossed the gravel path to the front steps;
reaching the hall door, he turned the handle
gently and found the door locked.</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy had no hand in the locking of the door.
The idea of inveigling Mr Boxall out on the
lawn to interview Mr Mooney was one of those
flash-in-the-pan ideas constantly occurring in
his harum-scarum brain; he had forgotten all
about the business in the preparations for the
burglar, and, had he known of Mr Boxall’s
plight, he would have been the first to let him
in. Of course, the excluded one could have
knocked, but that would have meant explanations,
so he temporised; in the midst of his indecision,
the clock in the turret struck the half-hour after
eleven. Mr Boxall was on the point of knocking,
when the idea occurred to him to go round the
house on the chance of finding a back door open,
and, in putting this scheme into operation,
he lost his way in the “scrubbery.” It had
gone twelve, when through an opening in the
laurels he saw Patsy’s window and two dark forms
standing before it. Mr Boxall paused to watch.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c013'>Ten minutes passed; they seemed an hour.
Could anything have happened to Mr Murphy?
Then, all at once, a faint noise, as of a foot
upon gravel, came from the outside, and, dim
and vague as a fish at the pane of a twilit aquarium
tank, a figure blurred the window.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Fanshawe gave Larry Lyburn a prod with
his elbow, half to awaken that individual’s wits
to their full activity, half for company’s sake.</p>

<p class='c013'>The form of the house-breaker darkened the
window space; they could hear the rubbing
of his shoulders against the sash. A stick was
thrust into the room, and tapped upon the floor,
then came the sound of the millifluous voice of
Mr Murphy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Patsy, avick,” said Mr Murphy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is that yourself, Mr Murphy?” came Patsy’s
voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Meself and no other, thrue to time. Is the
ould lady a-bed?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She is.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then it’s I that’ll be takin’ her up the warmin’-pan
and the cough-drops if so be you have them
ready—wan minute, till I say a word to Con
Cogan.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He turned and spoke in a low voice to some
one beside him on the path, then he turned again
to the window.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Right!” cried Patsy; the rope flew through
the pulley, an ear-splitting yell pierced the house,
then a voice from the ceiling.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Holy Mary! I’m upside down. Help!
Murther! Thieves! Lave go of the band of
me britches!—who are yiz at all? Patsy!
Con!—the divil’s got a hold o’ me! Help!
I’m shtranglin’!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Strike a light, quick!” cried Mr Fanshawe.
“Keep a hold of the rope, Larry! Stop that
row, you idiot! Here—give us the matches—keep
tight hold of the rope, Larry!”</p>

<p class='c013'>A match flared up.</p>

<p class='c013'>From the upper part of the house, through
the ear-splitting shouts of the captured one,
could be heard the sounds of hurried feet, doors
banging, and all the sound of a house full of
people awakened by catastrophe at dead of night.</p>

<p class='c013'>The rope had caught Mr Murphy below his
centre of gravity. He was hanging head down.
He was kicking the plaster to pieces with his
feet, and striking wildly about him with his arms.
He had been carrying an open clasp-knife but
had dropped it; it lay on the floor, and Mr
Fanshawe kicked it under the bed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lave holt of me!” cried Mr Murphy, when
the light showed him an upside-down view of
his proper position, and the fact that the devil
had not got him by the band of his breeches.
“Lave holt of me, and I’ll go quiet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lower, away, Larry,” said Mr Fanshawe;
“get him half-way down till I feel his pockets
to see if he’s got any arms about him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Larry let the rope slip through the pulley
till the suspended one was three feet from the
floor, looking not unlike a lobster on the end
of a string.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s all right,” said Dicky, after a
hurried investigation. “Down with him—he’s
not armed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Next moment Mr Murphy was seated on the
floor with not a sign of fight in him. He put
his hand to the top of his head as if to see whether
it was on, and then he glanced round him at
his captors, the rope, the beam and the pulley,
taking the situation in with a dazed grin.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Faith, I thought I was goin’ to hiven,”
said Mr Murphy, “back-side up. Sure, it was
as nate a trap as ever I was caught in. Larry
Lyburn, who’s the gintleman at all? Open
your ugly gob and introjuice me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s Mr Fanshawe,” said Larry.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Faith, thin,” said Mr Murphy, “he’s a fine
figure of a gintleman, and it’s I that am proud to
make his acqueentance; and now that he’s done
pokin’ his fun at me, maybe he’ll be lettin’ me
say good-marnin’ to him, for it’s home I ought
to have been an hour ago.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look here,” said Mr Fanshawe, half amused
at the cool impudence of this speech, “what
are you doing here?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Faith, I’m sittin’ on the flure,” said Mr
Murphy, with an ape-like grin. Then, like a
flash, he flung himself forward, seized Mr Fanshawe
by the foot, and next moment the two
men were struggling in a life-and-death
embrace.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hit him a belt on the head wid the hammer!”
cried Patsy. “Have at him, Larry, or he’ll be
murdherin’ the masther.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t hit, don’t hit,” cried Dicky, “I’ve
got him under!”</p>

<p class='c013'>He had, in fact, got a knee on either arm of
his opponent, and Mr Murphy, helpless as a
baby, lay on the flat of his back staring up at his
captor panting, and with a grin on his broad, red
face.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, you bounder,” cried Dicky, “what
do you mean—eh!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Aisy, aisy!” gasped the recumbent one.
“I gives in—sure, I was only makin’ a thry.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which is the better man?” asked Dick.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You, is, begorra!” cried Mr Murphy, with
a genuine ring in his tone. “Let me up on
me pins, and I’ll go aisy, but don’t be bindin’
me, or I’ll tear the house down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Up you get,” said Dicky. “You know
you have no chance with me, so I won’t bind
you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Faith, and I knew I was daelin’ wid a gintleman,”
said the other, standing up and shaking
himself. “Glory be to God, who’s this?”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was General Grampound at the door in a
dressing-gown. He held a flat candlestick in
his hand; behind him, old James, the butler,
and Uncle Molyneux appeared like shades.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s all this?” cried the General.
“What’s this infernal row? Why, God bless
my soul, sir, do you know in whose house you
are? Who’s that ruffian? What’s the groom
doing here? What’s that rope?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who’s the ould gintleman, Larry?” asked
Mr Murphy, looking the strange figure of the
General up and down in an interested manner.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If you ask me one question at a time,” said
Dicky, to whom all the General’s questions
had been addressed, “I may be able to answer
you. This is a burglar I have just caught—I
caught him with that rope, and the infernal
row, as you call it, was made by him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then what the devil are you doing with
him?” cried General Grampound. “Why don’t
you bind him, eh? Why haven’t you sent
for the police?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh don’t bother,” cried Dicky, “I’ve
caught him when you were all snoring in bed,
asleep, and now you come down abusing me,
and asking questions. He’s mine, and I’ll do
jolly well what I like with him. Here, Murphy,
or whatever your name is, come along. Patsy,
lead the way to the potato room; you said
there were bars to the windows of it, we’ll lock
him up there.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you mean to tell me you are not going
to take the precaution to tie the ruffian’s hands?”
cried General Grampound.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Listen to the ould cuckatoo!” cried Mr
Murphy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shut up!” said Dicky. “Go before me.
Patsy, lead the way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He caught Mr Murphy by the arm and pushed
him along protesting. Larry Lyburn and old
James followed to help in the incarceration,
and Uncle Molyneux and the General retired
upstairs to quiet the women folk—the General,
like Mr Murphy, protesting.</p>

<p class='c013'>The potato room was a large stone chamber.
It had bars to the window, and the window looked
out on the stable-yard. It was really a store-room,
where all sorts of things were kept—sacks
of flour and meal, hams, sides of bacon, everything
but potatoes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In you go,” said Mr Fanshawe, when they
reached the door. “I’ll get you a mattress or
something to sleep on, and you can tell your
story to the police in the morning. Sit down
on that sack there and wait till we come back.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Misther Fanshawe!” said Paddy Murphy,
as he took his seat on the sack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m powerful dhry.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll get you some water.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure, I’m not a dhromedary to be drinkin’
wather at this hour of the night,” said Mr Murphy
in a wheedling tone.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll see what I can do,” said Dicky. He
shut the door and locked it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He can have the mattress off my bed, sir,”
said Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, that’ll do. And, see, here Patsy, run
up to the dining-room and get a glass of whisky
for him out of the tantalus stand; give him a
good big one.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Five minutes later Mr Fanshawe re-entered
the potato room followed by Patsy dragging the
mattress.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Murphy was smoking a short black pipe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is the ould gintleman a-bed?” asked Mr
Murphy, in the tone of a fellow-conspirator, and
speaking in a half-muted, confidential voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He is,” said Dicky.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Me respects,” said Mr Murphy, tasting the
half tumbler of John Jameson. He grinned
with satisfaction, and Dicky contemplated him
for a moment. This was a type of the human
animal he had never come across before.</p>

<p class='c013'>Quite well he knew that, if there were a ghost
of a chance, Mr Murphy would have attacked
him with the ferocity of a tiger.</p>

<p class='c013'>An atrocious villain—that was Mr Murphy in
three words. Yet there was a certain humour
and a certain amount of <i>bonhomie</i> in the man
that, contrasted with his other qualities, made
him, in a way, attractive.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Put the mattress be the furthest corner
from the door, Patsy,” said Mr Murphy, as
though he were directing a chamber-maid.
“And you may lave me the candle, for it’s
afeared I am of the rats.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There aren’t any rats,” said Dicky, “and
I’m going to leave you no candle—don’t want
the house burnt down. Here—get on your
mattress before I take away the light.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Murphy rather grumblingly complied.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll take this ould bit of a sack for a pilla’,”
said he, rolling an old sack up and putting it
under his head. “Musha! but it smells of onions;
no mather, beggars can’t be chosers. Patsy,
haven’t you got a blankit to cover me wid?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bother the chap!” cried Mr Fanshawe,
“we’ve forgot a blanket; hurry off, Patsy, and
fetch one.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy did as he was told, and returned in a
moment with a blanket.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Murphy took it, spread it over himself,
drank off the remains of the whisky at a gulp,
placed his pipe on the stone floor at his elbow,
and turned on his side.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Plesint dhrames,” said Mr Murphy in a
drowsy voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Same to you,” said Mr Fanshawe. “Now
then, Patsy, go before me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They left the room and locked the door.
Just as the key turned Mr Murphy’s voice came
sleepily:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Patsy!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Misther Murphy?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bring me me hot wather at eight.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” said Mr Fanshawe, “that chap takes
the bun!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s only his way, sir,” said Patsy. “He
pretinds to joke with you, but all the same he’d
slit your throat if he had the chanst for two
brass farthin’s.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then Patsy went off to his room, but he did
not go to bed. He sat on the side of it for a
long time debating matters in his mind.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had saved Lady Molyneux’s jewels, he
had not betrayed his trust, he had helped in
the capture of the worst character in the county.
He had done his duty, in fact, but he was not
thinking of that.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had proposed, it will be remembered,
that Mr Fanshawe should load a gun with bullets
and blow Paddy Murphy’s head off, and he
had made the proposition in all seriousness.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Paddy free and Paddy in prison were
different people. All the sympathy in his queer
nature was aroused for the man in the potato
room, for prison, to the Celtic imagination, is
a far more terrible thing than death.</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy got off his bed and, candle in hand,
left his room; he came down the passage to the
cupboard where the under-gardener kept his
tool-chest.</p>

<p class='c013'>He took a file from it, came back up the passage
to the potato room door, slipped the file under
the door, and knocked.</p>

<p class='c013'>A loud snore was the only answer. He knocked
again without eliciting a reply.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s aslape,” muttered Patsy; “but maybe
he’ll see it when he wakes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Upstairs, Mr Boxall, who had taken advantage
of the open window to enter the house during
Mr Murphy’s incarceration in the potato room,
was making plans to leave Ireland to the Irish
as soon as might be.</p>

<p class='c013'>The incident of Mr Mooney, the outcries of
Mr Murphy, the whole affair, in short, was
incomprehensible to his mind, and only to be
summed up in one formula: “D——d savages.”</p>

<div class='pbb'>

</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch30' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXX <br /> <br /> “PUT THE DUNKEY TO”</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>It was perhaps through the mouth of Con Cogan
that wind of the matter got about. However,
that may have been, it is certain that by eight
o’clock next morning the news was all over the
country-side that Paddy Murphy had been
caught and was a prisoner in Glen Druid House.</p>

<p class='c013'>From cabin to cabin, from Castle Knock to
Shepherd’s Cross, the news went, filling hearts
with exultation and a sneaky sort of sorrow.</p>

<p class='c013'>Paddy was feared and hated. Mark you, I
do not put it hated and feared, for in the Irish
mind there is a lot of difference between the
two statements.</p>

<p class='c013'>The hatred he had caused was not the leaden
and colourless hatred which a landlord or a tyrant
can inspire; it was born entirely of his lawless
and desperate acts of ruffianism, and therefore
had a romantic tinge.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was hated because he was feared, and now
that fear of him became remote, the hatred of
him began to fade from the public mind.</p>

<p class='c013'>Cattle-driving was going on merrily beyond
Shepherd’s Cross, and all the police were clumped
in that district as busy as bees; the one constable
at Tullagh was down with the influenza. These
facts were remembered and quoted with a certain
glee.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So Paddy is nailed at last!” cried Mr Mullins,
the cobbler, to Mr Mahony across the road.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So I b’lave,” said Mr Mahony.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They’ve got him at the Big House, shut up
in the cowl-cellar I hear,” said Mr Mullins.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Faith, if they don’t relase him it won’t be
a cowl-cellar long,” replied the sweep.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It was Con who let him in, they say.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Faith, then, it’ll be the worse for Con, I’m
thinking, when they let him out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Begob, yes,” said Mr Mullins.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Stone, the “cow-doctor” (he doctored
horses too, and sheep, but cows were his speciality),
riding by on an animal that recalled nothing so
much as Wallenstein’s<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c019'><sup>[2]</sup></a> horse, drew up.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So Paddy’s took,” said Mr Stone.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So we was sayin’,” replied Mr Mullins.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’ll he get, at all?” asked Mr Stone, of
no one in particular.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seven year, if he gets an hour,” replied the
sweep.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ohone!” cried Mrs Mahony, who was standing
in the doorway behind her lord and master
with the inevitable baby in her arms. “Sure,
it’s crool to think of it, a fine figure of a man
like him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>She was voicing the general opinion of the
female population, for, though Paddy was short,
he was well built, and his deeds had given him
at least two extra inches of stature.</p>

<p class='c013'>“When the drink was in him, he wasn’t to
hold or bind,” said Mr Stone reflectively.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But he always kept his legs,” said Mr Mullins.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ay, he always kept his legs,” said Mr Stone.</p>
<div class='footnote c020' id='f2'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. “The head, neck, legs, and part of the body have been

<p class='c013'>“O’Farrell’s hounds are meetin’ on the lawn
of the Big House,” went on the cow-doctor after
a pause.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Tin o’clock,” said Bob Mahony.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Are yiz goin’?” asked the cobbler.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Maybe and not,” replied the sweep, who,
since the affair of Mr Boxall, had risen still
further in the estimation of the people. He
had floored a Member of Parliament. The
deed was accidental, but, still, he was only the
man in the county, or the country either, who
had done such a thing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Here comes Billy the Buck,” said Mr Stone;
“maybe he’ll have news. Any news, Billy?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Billy, amongst his other avocations, served
as a sort of living newspaper. His grandfather
had been a gabberlunzy man, and the news-bearing
property was in him, just as the art of
pointing is in a pointer or retrieving in a spaniel.
That his news was mostly lies only showed that
he was an artist in his profession. (<i>Item.</i>—He
never told lies about foxes.)</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s a fox an a vixin in the siven acres,”
replied Billy, drawing up like a horse.</p>

<p class='c013'>A roar of laughter greeted this information.
Billy, for once, was out of it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What the divil are yiz brayin’ about?”
asked Billy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where’s your ears?” asked Mr Mahony.</p>

<p class='c013'>“On me head,” replied Billy—“no need
to ax where yours is. What are yiz gettin’
at?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Haven’t you heard of Paddy Murphy?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What ails Paddy Murphy?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s locked up in the cowl-hole of the Big
House,” replied Mr Mahony.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You lie!” replied Billy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Tell him,” said the sweep, addressing Mr
Mullins.</p>

<p class='c013'>The cobbler, glad for once to take the journalistic
shine out of Billy, gave a detailed report
of the capture of Paddy Murphy, to which Billy
listened with deep attention and an asinine
expression of wonder on his long yellow face,
scratching his head now and then, and now and
then uttering ejaculations of surprise.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is it the threwth you’re tellin’ me?” asked
Billy, when the recital was over.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And where did you get your information
from?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not from you,” replied the cobbler.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No,” replied Billy, “for, if you had, you’d
a’ got it right. Paddy’s in no cowl-hole, he’s
locked in the pitato room of the Big House.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And where did <i>you</i> get your information
from, may I ax?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“From himself.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And where did you see him?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Tin minits ago, wid his face at the pitato
room winda and him filing his way out through
the bars. I wint up to see Larry Lyburn about
a bit of a bizness, and Larry says to me, ‘Billy,’
he says. ‘What?’ says I. ‘Listen,’ he says.
We was standin’ by the coach-house dure, and
I listened, and, sure enough, I hears the sound of
a file. The pitato room winda is hid from the
stable-yard by an arm of the wall, and, sure
enough, at the bars of it, there was Paddy’s big
red face and him filin’ away at a bar. ‘I’m
cocht,’ says Paddy. ‘Begorra, you look it,’
says I. ‘But I’m not cocht yet,’ says he, with a
grin. ‘If the file houlds I’ll be out in two hours’
hard work.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>Billy halted, dead, and looked around him
upon his discomfited audience.</p>

<p class='c013'>“O’Farrell’s hounds meet at the Big House
at tin o’clock,” said Mr Stone. “I was jew be
this to see Mr Moriarty’s cow. She’s swallowed
a dish-clath off a hedge, bad scran to her! and
can’t get shut of it—but she’ll have to wait for
me attindance till afther the meet. I wouldn’t
miss it for two hundred cows, for you mark me
words, there’ll be things to be seen.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Faith,” said Mr Mullins, “I had this pair
of brogues to finish be twelve, but, begorra!
if I never struck another peg I’ll be wid you to see
the fun.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the time now?” asked Mr Mahony.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gone nine,” replied Mr Stone.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Mahony paused for a second in thought,
then:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Billy!” cried he.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, daddy?” came a voice from the back
of the cottage.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Put the dunkey to.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch31' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXXI <br /> <br /> THE FOX AND THE HOUNDS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“The meet of the hounds which took place
this morning on the lawn of Glen Druid House
stands unparalleled in the history of Irish sport.
To begin with, half the country-side attended,
and the hounds never turned up at all——”</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c013'>This extract is from the <i>Tullagh Guardian</i>
taken <i>verbatim</i>—and I would quote the whole
article, some three columns long, and make it
do duty for this chapter, if it were not that the
bald facts given by the pressman are such that
I have to shave them to make them more
presentable.</p>

<p class='c013'>At a quarter to ten the grounds in front of the
Big House were swarming. The thing resembled
a village <i>fête</i> in preparation rather than a sporting
fixture. Not only was Mr Mahony present, but
his wife; not only his wife, but his children.</p>

<p class='c013'>Widdy Finnegan was also to the fore; and
old Mr Finnegan, who never stirred out on
any account, unless for a wake, was there on his
stick.</p>

<p class='c013'>Shan Finucane, with Rafter at his heels, was
present, and Shan never turned up for a meet
of the fox-hounds on any ordinary account.
Shepherd’s Cross had vomited its entire population,
Tullagh had sent a big contingent; the
whole population, except the pigs, the hens, and
one bed-ridden individual of Castle Knock, had
turned out; and even Castle Connell, a tiny hamlet
seven miles away, had sent its representative
to swell the crowd. A ragamuffin selling peanuts
completed the picture.</p>

<p class='c013'>Looking and listening, one could not but perceive
that there was something on of more sinister
and breathless interest than a meet of the fox-hounds.
A great joke seemed to have been
divided into small pieces amongst the people;
even the children had bits of it and there was a
hush in the turmoil, a muteness in the clamour
which, coupled with bursts of laughter that
shook every now and then the whole assembly,
might have caused apprehension in the mind
of an experienced Resident Magistrate had one
been present.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was also a movement in the throng,
a drift which, had you followed it, would have
taken you round the corner of the house to the
stable-yard and back again.</p>

<p class='c013'>Back again, for every individual having feasted
his eyes on the sight to be seen retraced his steps,
so that the show might not be given away.</p>

<p class='c013'>The sight was Mr Murphy.</p>

<p class='c013'>The broad, red face of Mr Murphy as he filed
away at the bars of the potato room window
was a sight indeed.</p>

<p class='c013'>One bar was out, and he was completing the
demolition of the second, sweating but cool,
grinning like a cat, and exchanging jokes with
friends and enemies alike.</p>

<p class='c013'>There were men and women in the throng
who had good cause to hate Paddy Murphy,
but there was not a man or a woman who had
even the thought of betraying him. A whisper
would have ruined him if conveyed to the
“quality” in the house; but no one whispered.
Larry Lyburn, the coachman, the stable helpers,
all knew what was on; yet they led out Mr
Fanshawe’s horse, and a horse for General Grampound
and a horse for Miss Lestrange, and did
the business, deaf and dumb to everything else.
Mrs Kinsella knew what was afoot, and the maids;
as for Patsy, when he had brought the prisoned
one some breakfast, he had brought him also
another file.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was all very wrong, of course; but there
it was. There was not an ounce of sympathy
for Paddy Murphy, but a lot for his condition.
Prison to all these minds was as bad as death,
and they helped him, just as they would have
helped him had he been drowning in the pond.</p>

<p class='c013'>Whilst helping they jeered at him and joked
with him, knowing well enough that he would
never after take revenge for these jeers with
the remembrance of their silence in his mind.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s no signs of the polis yet, is there,
Micky Strachan?” asked Paddy, as he filed away.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not a speck,” replied the individual addressed;
“they’re all beyant at Shepherd’s
Cross.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Take your teeth to it, Paddy,” suggested
an individual over Micky Strachan’s shoulder.
“Make room for me, and don’t be blockin’ the
winda!” cried another. “Here, Mr Mahony,
hould up Billy to have a look.” “Oh, musha!
musha! will yiz look at him?—he’s got wan
bar out, and the other’s near gone.” “Stick
your back end through, Paddy, and we’ll pull
yiz.” “Put wan ear through at a time.”
“Arrah! lave the man be, and don’t be jestin’
at him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>To all these advisers, jesters and sympathisers
Mr Murphy replied in kind; for he had a tongue
like a rapier, and a wit that was pungent, and—the
pity of it—nine times out of ten unprintable.</p>

<p class='c013'>As he replied to the jesters and the jeerers
and the sympathisers, he filed away for hard life,
yet as unflurriedly and methodically as a locksmith
on a time job.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then, suddenly, having gauged to a nicety
the extent of his work, he dropped his file, seized
the bar, and the crowd cleared before the window
as they would have cleared before the cage of
an escaping tiger.</p>

<p class='c013'>For one moment of ferocious energy he wrestled
with it, the veins on his forehead swelling, his
knuckles white as marble, his teeth exposed,
and his eyes tight shut—a terrific spectacle—then
snap, bang! the thing gave, and he tumbled
backwards into the room.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Paddy’s out!” yelled the crowd with delightful
inconsequence, scattering devious as though
from the path of a python.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch32' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXXII <br /> <br /> THE FOX TAKES EARTH</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Meanwhile at the front of the house things
had been happening. Larry and a subordinate
stable helper had brought round Mr Fanshawe’s
horse, and the horses for General Grampound
and Miss Lestrange.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I must speak to you alone,” said Dicky, as
he helped the girl into her saddle—“not a word
here.—Row? You saw us at breakfast—he
has sworn not to speak to me again—it’s over that
business last night. Hush, here he is.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He swung into his own saddle as his uncle came
down the steps, and mounted the elephantine
grey which Larry Lyburn was holding for him.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was at this moment that a ragged individual,
of the type which is all eyes for disaster, and all
ears for bad news, and all tongue for telling it,
yelled out:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Here’s wan of the whips riding hell for leather.
Musha! but somethin’ must a’ happened to the
houn’s!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Right across the park he was coming, a dingy
scarlet figure on a big brown horse.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s Billy Croom, the second whip!” cried
Mr Mahony, who was standing up in his cart.
“Will yiz look at the face of him, white as
chalk!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The huntsman took the sunk fence dividing
the great lawn from the grasslands, and, full
gallop, came, scattering the crowd to right and to
left till ten paces from where General Grampound,
Dicky Fanshawe and Miss Lestrange were grouped
he reined in, bringing the big brown mare on her
haunches.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No mate!” cried Billy. “Mr O’Farrell’s
tumbled down the stairs and killed hisself—Musha!
don’t all be axin’ me at once—He’s
fell from the first flure down to the haal—I
left the docther settin’ his arum—an’ he won’t
be in the saddle agin for a month. ‘Into the
saddle wid you, Billy,’ says Mrs O’Farrell, and
she near crazy, ‘and aff you go wid my respects
and give ’m the news.’ Stan’ clear and don’t
be crowdin’ me—mind wid that stick, and don’t
be proddin’ it into the mare, or it’s stars she’ll
be kickin’ out of you—she ain’t an umbrilla
stand. What was you afther sayin’, sir?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am asking you, is Mr O’Farrell dead or
not?” said General Grampound, who had been
vainly endeavouring to make his voice heard
in the hubbub.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, sir; he’s only bruck his arum.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then what the deuce do you mean by saying
he had killed himself?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who’d killed hisself?” asked Billy, unaccustomed
to be taken literally, and nettled at
the tone of the questioner.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr O’Farrell—are you deaf?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who’s you talkin’ to?” replied the whip,
a man with one of those long, dark, narrow,
devilish, fighting faces one meets with sometimes
amidst the Irish sporting classes.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before the General could reply—and well for
him, perhaps—at this moment up went the cry
from the stable-yard:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Paddy’s out!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Paddy’s out!” yelled the throng, forgetting
the disputants and surging towards the stable
side of the house. “Brayvo, Paddy! Where
is he? Afther him, and let’s chase him! Boys!
boys! this’ll be the fun an’ all. Set the houn’s
afther him—there ain’t no houn’s—afther him
on fut! Crack him on the head if yiz catch him.
No quarther, no quarther!—sure, he’s biled
babies alive, the blackguyard! There he is,
runnin’. Shan’s cotched him! No, he ain’t—he’s
free. Afther him, afther him!”</p>

<p class='c013'>A furious crowd surrounded the stable entrance,
from which broke the figure of a man running.</p>

<p class='c013'>The extraordinary fact stands, take it how
you will, that the crowd who had sympathised
and assisted in Mr Murphy’s escape were now,
immediately on his enlargement, all against
him and eager to catch him. The spirit of pity
had vanished with the breaking of the bars, the
spirits of pursuit and revenge broke loose, and
who knows what might have happened but for
Billy Croom, the whip, who, galloping in a semi-circle,
faced and herded back the pursuing crowd
with his devilish expression and long whip.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Fair play!” shouted Billy, letting into the
would-be hunters with his whip. “Give him
two minits’ law and let him have a run for his
money. Back you get, y’ divils, give him till
he’s over the sunk fence—wait me word! There,
he’s over! <i>Tally ho!</i> hark forrard!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look!” cried Violet, “they are chasing
him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now’s our time,” said Dicky. “Uncle’s
away over there to the left—let’s pretend to
follow the chase; leave everything to me. Can
you take the sunk fence?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Rather!” said she.</p>

<p class='c013'>The hunted one had got a good start; he had
left the sunk fence far behind him, and was
making for the woods. Behind him, out-streaming
like the tail of a fan-tail comet, came the
populace.</p>

<p class='c013'>Billy Croom, who could have ridden the
quarry down easily, was far too good a sportsman
for that. He was riding at a trot, and from a
distance you could see that he was treating the
pursuers after the fashion of a pack of hounds—that
is to say, with encouragement of voice and
whip, especially the latter.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was having more fun out of the business
than any one else. The General riding near
Billy seemed to be doing a great deal of shouting.</p>

<p class='c013'>“To the right now!” said Dicky, when they
had cleared the fence. “They are all on ahead,
and we can cut straight across to the woods.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Murphy was also making for the woods
but far lower down, and he “went to earth,”
to judge by the roar of the pursuing pack, just
as the lovers reached the shelter of the trees.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let’s get off and leave the horses here,”
said Dicky. “I must have a good long talk to
you. Patsy ought to be somewhere near. I
told him this morning to watch out for us, and
keep close to us. I told him we’d most likely
take shelter in these trees.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Listen!” said Violet.</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy that morning, with rare fidelity and
close attention to business, had forsaken his
duties and all delights, and posted himself
in the branches of a beech tree. From this
vantage he could see the “meet.” He saw
Billy Croom riding furiously up and delivering
his message. He saw the pursuit of Mr Murphy,
he saw Violet and Dicky Fanshawe’s manœuvre.</p>

<p class='c013'>Directly they turned beyond the sunk fence
and rode towards the wood, he saw what they
were after, marked their direction, came down
the beech tree with the rapidity of a monkey
and made through the wood to meet them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! there you are,” said Mr Fanshawe.
“Take the horses, Patsy, and lead them back
to the stable. We will return on foot.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir,” said Patsy, taking the bridles.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This way,” said Dicky, leading Violet, who
was holding her short habit in one hand. He
led her amidst the trees which were sparsely
set, till, on looking round, nothing was to be
seen but the tree-boles, the withered fern under
foot and above, through the tracery of the
branches, the dull December day. Here Mr
Fanshawe struck his head in a dramatic fashion.
“I have been half-mad all the morning to have a
word with you. Violet, it’s all up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What?” asked Violet, half-alarmed at the
distraction visible in her companion.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Everything, the whole game. He and you
are going away to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dicky! what on earth do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll tell you. But first tell me, what did
you hear last night?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I lay awake waiting, that is to say, I didn’t
go to bed; just lay down with my clothes on.
I heard the clock strike twelve; then a long
time passed, and then,” said Violet, “I heard
a most awful yell.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That was when we caught him. Go on.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It went on to squeals just like a pig. I
heard doors banging, and <i>his</i> voice and his
language, and other voices, then everything
was quiet. Then I lay listening to Lady Seagrave
snoring. She is so deaf she heard nothing,
and she sleeps in the next room. Then I heard
your knock, I said ‘Yes,’ and then I heard——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, go on.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Your dear voice,” said Violet, nestling her
cheek against his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Fanshawe gulped, and pressed her to him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then,” said Violet, “you asked me to open
the door and say good-night, and I said ‘No,’
and you said ‘Yes,’ and then I opened it. Then
I said good-night and shut my door, and—that’s
all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Fanshawe groaned.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wish it were,” he said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He saw us.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“When?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“When I—Violet, dear—kissed you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Her face flushed scarlet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I was coming down the passage,” went on
Mr Fanshawe, “going to my room, after leaving
you, when some one grasped me by the arm.
It was uncle. He had been standing in the dark
at his door, and he saw everything, for, you
remember, I had a lighted candle in my hand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go on,” said Violet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He drew me into his room——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Tell me exactly what he said.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I never swear before ladies,” said Mr Fanshawe,
with a miserable attempt at jocularity,
“but what he said, as far as I remember, was
something like this: ‘Now, sir—now, sir—now,
sir—now, sir—what the blank—what the blank—what
the blank do you mean, sir? What
the blank do you mean, you hound?’”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He called you a hound?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He called me a hound.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But this is serious, Dicky.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Very especially for me, as I could not strike
him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What did you say?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I said, I believe, ‘Thank you, sir.’ It
wasn’t a very brilliant observation, under the
circumstances.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Violet put her hands round his neck, drew
his face down and kissed it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I love you for having said it,” said she.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That makes up. But I felt pretty bad,
never felt worse. I declare to heaven,” suddenly
broke out Mr Fanshawe, “I can’t understand
human nature. Here’s a man as brave as they
make them, a D.S.O., and all that, with the
heart of a bitter old maid——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go on,” said Violet. “What happened
then?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He said things about you, and—I ran away.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ran away?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You see, if I had stayed I must have knocked
him down. I told him he was a liar before I
left him, though; other things, too, that I want
to forget——”</p>

<p class='c013'>Violet sighed one of those deep sighs that
speak not of sorrow or lackadaisical affectation.
Her eyes were sparkling.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If I could be glad about anything so horrible,”
she said, “I would be glad he spoke like that
about me, for now I don’t care if I do——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Run away with you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Fanshawe again pressed her close to him.
They were walking, sauntering, all this time
through the wood in any direction Fate might
lead them. He sighed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s the rub,” said he.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will tell you. Patsy comes in here. This
morning at seven, General Grampound, my
revered uncle, rang his bell. Patsy answered it.
Patsy was commissioned to tell a maid to tell Lady
Seagrave that General Grampound requested
an interview with her ‘at once’ on business of
the gravest importance. Lady Seagrave replied
that she would see him at eight o’clock in her
boudoir.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A few minutes after eight the boudoir bell
rang, and Patsy, who scented mischief, answered
it. He found the General and the lady together,
but unable to communicate, as the lady in her
hurry had left her ear-trumpet on her dressing-room table.
Patsy was sent to fetch it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Fanshawe paused, and, despite his dejection,
chuckled.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Patsy,” he went on, “does not love my uncle.
Patsy, as far as I can understand his character,
is a compound of Machiavelli, Bismarck, Puck,
and one of Shakespeare’s fools all compressed
into a page-boy in buttons. Patsy saw the
ear-trumpet on the table, and by the trumpet
a bottle of eau de Cologne. The combination
would have meant nothing to an ordinary person,
but in Patsy’s mind it suggested the idea of playing
the ‘ould Gineral a trick.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go on,” said Violet interestedly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He took the cork from the eau de Cologne
bottle and popped it into the ear-trumpet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, bravo, Patsy!” cried Miss Lestrange.
“Go on, go on!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not only did he pop it in, but he rammed
it tight, with a long button-hook. Then he
brought the ear-trumpet down, handed it to
Lady Seagrave, and shut the door. Then he
listened.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What did he hear?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“As far as I can gather, it was like listening
to a scene in a French farce. You know, the
old girl hates to be thought deaf, and my uncle
hates to be thought stupid. Strange, that people
with such obvious defects should try to hide them.
The General began to explain himself; she
requested him to speak louder. He bellowed,
and she asked him was he deaf. They seemed
to have insulted one another for a quarter of
an hour or so without getting any ‘forrader’;
at all events, he was unable to tell her what
he wanted to tell her, about us last night.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank heaven!” said Violet. “Not that I
would care a button about any one knowing,
but, O Dicky, women feel about things differently
to men, and you can’t think the—the—<i>deep</i>
satisfaction that eau de Cologne cork has given
to my mind. She is such a meddler, such a
fusser, and she has such notions of propriety.
You can’t understand an old lady of that sort,
because you are not a woman. If she had heard
what he said, she would have made you go off
at once—I know her.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why,” cried Dicky, “that was just what
he was trying to ask her to do! Patsy told
me he began by asking her to send me off at
once, as I was conducting myself in an ungentlemanly
manner, and ruining your prospects of
marriage——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We had two enemies to our happiness,”
said Violet, “Patsy has made one confound
the other. What did she say to all that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She said, ‘Speak louder,’” replied Mr Fanshawe
with a grim chuckle.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I can’t help thinking that there is a
Providence at work,” said Miss Lestrange devoutly—“this
happening and Mr Boxall getting
influenza. She was putting him into my pocket
at every opportunity. She had made up a
party for to-day in a closed carriage, to go to
Tullagh. She, and I, and He, and Lady Molyneux—ugh!—but
now this blessed influenza.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t!” said Dicky, suddenly catching
hold of a tree and doubling himself up in convulsions
of merriment. “This is too much—it’s not
influenza.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is it, Dicky?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I can’t tell—see here, Violet——It’s a
sneaky thing to say things about another man—I
<i>must</i> tell, though. Boxall isn’t in bed because
of the influenza.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What, then?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Patsy collared his eye.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“His <i>what</i>?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“His artificial one. It popped out of his head
when that sweep chap hit him. Patsy saw it
on the road, and put it in his pocket.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh!” said Miss Lestrange.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s sent a telegram for another one,”
went on Mr Fanshawe; “Cupid’s messenger,
you know—ha! ha! ha!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Lestrange did not go into the same
convulsions of merriment. To a girl every man
who presents himself in the guise of a suitor,
whether he is acceptable or wildly impossible,
is a sort of trinket, a personal possession—at
the lowest, a scalp. A woman, whatever she
may pretend, feels a kindly interest at heart for
<i>any</i> man who admires and loses his heart to her.</p>

<p class='c013'>Had Mr Mahony, soot bags and all, fallen
honestly and wildly in love with Miss Lestrange,
Miss Lestrange, while scouting and loathing
and closing the doors against her dusky suitor,
would still have felt for him an interest; and,
had he broken his leg, the news would have been
of more moment to her than the news of a similar
accident befalling Mr Mullins or Billy the Buck,
or any other male biped of the same species.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Patsy,” said Miss Lestrange, “seems to have
had a lot to do with our affairs; is it Fate or
just—Patsy?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s accident,” replied Dicky, whom a grave
thought had suddenly sobered. “Ireland is
an accident factory; these things could never
happen in England. An Irishman creates an
accident and then somehow makes events from
it. Patsy doesn’t do things of a set purpose,
but he takes hold of opportunity, and he can
make more of an accident than most people.
But the thing that is bothering me is this.
Though Patsy, by means of an eau de Cologne
cork, has stopped me from being summarily
expelled, all the Patsys and all the eau de Cologne
corks in the world won’t stop uncle from leaving
and taking you away with him. He’s going
to-morrow by the 8.15 from Tullagh station.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How do you know?” asked Violet. “He
has not said a word to me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, I don’t suppose he will till this evening;
all the same, he is going. The last words he said
in that fantastic interview with the old woman
were, that he would leave the house to-day, only
that he was too late to catch the 8.15, but that
he’d go to-morrow; and he has given orders
for the cart for the luggage, and the brougham
to take you to the station.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“This is dreadful,” said the girl. “Dicky,
it was the day after to-morrow——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes; at two in the morning <i>we</i> were to start.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They had wandered far by this. They had
crossed the drive and entered the woods on the
other side, walking in the direction of the Druids’
Altar. Breaking into a little glade they found
themselves before the ruin of a tree, the bole of
a great oak, broken off some ten feet from the
ground; it was the same oak in which Mr Murphy
had been hiding on the day we first made his
acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let us sit down for a minute and think,”
said the girl, pointing to the moss-grown roots
of the old tree.</p>

</div>
<p class='c012'>“But the game is not played out yet,” said
Mr Fanshawe; “we have nearly twenty-four
hours before us. I’ll hocus the horses, I’ll get
Patsy to take the lynch-pins out of the brougham,
I’ll do something—anything—before letting him
win like that. The case is desperate. It will
be two years before you are of age and your
own mistress.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Two years, three months and three—no—four
days,” said Miss Lestrange.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He will take you away from here and bottle
you up somewhere, or put you in Chancery or
something—I know him! He will keep you
so close I will never be able to see you or speak
to you. He will intercept my letters—we will be
able to make no plans. We will be separated
two years certain—I may die, you may die—you
may get to care for some one else. I have
a conviction that if we don’t carry out our plan,
and go away with one another day after to-morrow,
something will divide us for ever.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dicky!” said the girl.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You know what you said about doing something
to the horses or the carriage.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t—leave everything to me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What will you do?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Never mind; I have made a plan.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Tell me it,” said Dicky. “I may be able
to improve on it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will do as Mr Boxall has done.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But you haven’t a glass eye.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, but I can catch influenza.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hurrah!” cried Dicky. “I never thought
of that—but can you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do the thing properly. What are the symptoms
of influenza?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You sneeze,” said Violet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Can you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, I’m afraid I can’t; however, we’ll leave
that part out. I can say I’ve sneezed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What are the other symptoms?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Pains in the bones and headache—Dicky!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Lestrange suddenly pinched her companion’s
arm.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look!”</p>

<p class='c013'>A broad, red face was peeping at them from
behind a tree-bole.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, I’m blest if it isn’t the burglar chap!”
said Mr Fanshawe.</p>

<p class='c013'>The body belonging to the face came forth
from behind the tree-bole, and Mr Murphy,
greatly tattered, evidently exhausted, but still
grinning, stood before them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Faith,” said Mr Murphy, with a tone of
happy recognition, “it’s yourself, sor, and glad
I am to see you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Can’t return the compliment,” said Mr
Fanshawe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m bone dry,” said Mr Murphy, drawing
the back of his hand across his mouth. “Near
run off me legs. I’ve left me ould hat in the
brambles beyant, and it’s sorry I am to appear
before the young lady all rags an’ tatters—whisht!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Shouts and haloos came from the distance,
and the yapping of a dog.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They’re afther me still!” said Mr Murphy,
as though he were speaking to confederates.
“Listen to ’um, Mr Fanshawe, sir, you’re a
gintleman, you won’t be givin’ me away, will
you, if they axes have you seen me?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not I,” said Dicky. “But don’t waste time
here talking, hook it as hard as you can; they
are coming.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Unhappy man!” cried Violet, gazing with
dilated eyes at the tattered figure before her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Make haste! Dicky, have you no money
to give him to help him? Listen—they are
coming—don’t wait to be taken—fly!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s into the tree I’ll be flyin’ if you get off
me dure-step, miss,” said the pursued one,
buttoning the one button of his coat and preparing
to climb. “It’s me house is this ould tree, an’
I’ve lived in her a month wid me ear to the
ground for the polis. Aisy does it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He got on to the moss-grown root, placed
his arms round the bole, and, scrambling like
a great tom-cat, in half a moment was gone
from sight.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come,” said Dicky to the girl, “let us go.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wan minit,” came a voice from the tree.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, what is it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure, y’ ain’t goin’ to lave me!” complained
the voice. “If they strike the ould tree they’ll
sarch it sure. Misther Fanshawe!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“For the love of God, sit down an’ talk aisy
to the young lady. There’s Con Cogan knows
I’ve hid here, and wan or two more—the sight
of the young lady will drive thim away as the
blessed angels drives the divils.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, of all the cheek!” said Mr Fanshawe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dicky, dear!” said Violet, laying her hand
on his arm. “He’s running away.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, what of that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Think, if <i>we</i> were running away, if we were
chased, and if we found a tree to hide in, think
how glad we would be to have some one to—to
help us.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Listen to her voice!” came a voice from the
tree that seemed communing with itself. “Sure,
it’s like running wather over pebbles to hear
her.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It would be unlucky for us,” went on she,
“not to help a person who——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, it would,” said Dicky. “Sit down.
All right—we’ll do what we can for you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“God in hivin bless you; may God in hivin
rain His blessin’s on you; may the saints make
your bed, and the howly angels smooth your
pillas; may the——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shut up!” said Mr Fanshawe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Listen!” said Violet.</p>

<p class='c013'>Voices were audible in the wood close by.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Swear be all’s blew you saw me runnin’
towards Castle Knock,” came the voice, muted
and confidential.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hold your beastly tongue,” replied Mr
Fanshawe, irritated at the way in which the
rascal had made him a tool to assist his flight,
and the familiar tone of his voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Here they are,” said Violet.</p>

<p class='c013'>A spot of dingy scarlet showed through the
trees, and next moment Billy Croom, followed
by Con Cogan, broke into the glade.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s the tree!” cried Con. “Musha!
but who’s them?”</p>

<p class='c013'>When the rabble had run Mr Murphy to
earth, or rather into the wood, they paused.
They did not mind pursuing him across the
open a hundred strong. Pursuing him through
the wood was quite a different matter, for pursuit
through a wood means breaking up into small
parties, and there was not a man amongst
the lot who would have tackled Mr Murphy,
even with the assistance of a couple of others.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lave him be!” cried the populace. “Sure,
you might as well hunt for a needle in the siven
acres. More’s the pity, with the reward out
aginst him, and all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the reward?” asked Billy Croom.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A hundred pound.”<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c019'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>
<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. The reward, as entered in the Police Register, was £10;
ten times ten makes a hundred.</p>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“A hundred pound, and him in the wood!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ay, a hundred pound.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure, I’d chase a hundred divils through a
hundred woods for that,” said Billy Croom,
slipping off his horse. “Here, Bob Mahony,
take a hoult of the reins.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’ll murther you!” cried the populace.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Will he, begob?” said the whip, his lean,
dark, devilish face lighting up with battle.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr Croom!” came a voice. It was the voice
of Con Cogan, who, assured that the police were
absent, had been hanging round the tail of the
proceedings like a carrion crow.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is it?” asked Croom.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I can tell yiz where you’ll find ’um. What
will yiz give me?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll give you a tin poun’ note out of the
hundred,” replied the huntsman, approaching
close to Con.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then you can hand it over, for he’s in the
ould oak tree widout a top to it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where’s that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure, where would it be, but in the wood?”</p>

<p class='c013'>The populace tittered. They thought Con
was “having” the whip, otherwise such base
treachery would have condemned Mr Cogan
to a speedy and literal downfall.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What part of the wood?” demanded the whip.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Two hundred yards, maybe, to the lift of
the drive, before you rache the turnin’ to the
Druids’ Althar.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s gave Paddy away!” cried the onlookers,
who perceived from the exact directions that
there was no joking in the matter. “He’s
bethrayed him—oh, the baste!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lave him to me,” said Croom, as disgusted
as the rest, but still determined to use Mr Cogan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, then, you holy scarecrow, lay on to the
sint, into the wood wid you before me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They were a picture. The lean, dark-faced
whip all fight and energy; Con, with his brigand’s
appearance, and his face of an ideal stage-robber,
wilting before the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lay on!” cried the huntsman.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let up!” cried Con. “Lave me be—who
are you afther talking to? Help! Mary!
Moses!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The thong of the whip curled round his legs.
Then, whip in one hand and grasping the collar
of Con’s old coat in the other, Croom ran the
villain in amidst the trees, and they were lost to
sight.</p>

<p class='c013'>The populace danced.</p>

<p class='c013'>“On you go before me,” said Croom, releasing
the collar. “Play me crucked, and I’ll brain
yiz with the butt-end of me whip.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll go quiet,” replied the other. “But,
sure, it’s the fear of Paddy Murphy that’s before
me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Faith, it’s the fear of Billy Croom that’s
behind yiz. On you go. Which way, now?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“To the lift.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Con led fair and straight, and in ten minutes
they had reached the little path that led to the
Druids’ Altar.</p>

<p class='c013'>“To the lift again,” said Con. “There’s
the ould tree—musha, but who’s them!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sit quiet,” said Mr Fanshawe to Violet;
“we may be able to bluff them without telling
lies.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Con, seeing Mr Fanshawe and knowing the
strength of Croom, began to lose fear of Paddy
Murphy, and did not bolt away as he might
otherwise have done, but waited—for his own
undoing—to see the sport.</p>

<p class='c013'>Croom touched his hat to Mr Fanshawe’s
scarlet coat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Beg pardon, sir,” said he, “but have you
seen a sight of that chap we was chasin’?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have,” replied Mr Fanshawe. “What
do you want with him?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Faith,” said Croom, “I want to kitch him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And what do you want to catch him for?”
asked Mr Fanshawe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You must ax the polis that,” replied the
huntsman. “They can bile him, for all I care,
all I wants is to kitch him, and if you axes me
why, it’s because there’s a hundred pounds
reward aginst him, and I’ve a wife and childer.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, you can go home to your wife and
childer, and tell them you’ve lost a hundred
pounds to-day, for you’re not going to catch him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A blaze came into the eyes of Billy Croom
and was smothered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m not wishful to be disrespectful, sir,”
said Billy, “I’m axing you have you seen him?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I told you before, I have.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And where was that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Here.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Con Cogan!” said the whip.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” replied Con.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is this the tree or not.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, then, sir,” said Billy, “I’m not wishin’
to be disrespectful, but is the chap in the ould
tree behind you, or is he not?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He is,” replied Mr Fanshawe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s all right,” said the whip, buttoning
his coat and approaching the tree. “It’s worse
than tacklin’ a badger in a barrel, but I’ll do
it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stop,” said Mr Fanshawe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who’s goin’ to stop me?” enquired Billy,
the blaze lighting up again in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“For sure?” said Billy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, for sure, he’s under my protection—do
you want him?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m goin’ to have him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I say, do you want him?” repeated Mr
Fanshawe, rising to his feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“O’ course I want him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then, you’ll have to fight me for him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“O Dicky!” murmured Violet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s a question of honour,” said Mr Fanshawe.
“I don’t know why I should fight this scoundrel’s
battles, but he has placed himself under my protection,
and I’m not going to give him up.”
Then, in a lower voice: “You wouldn’t have it
otherwise?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No,” said Violet, shivering; “but tell me
before you begin, and I’ll shut my eyes, and—stop
my ears.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Misther Fanshawe.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The voice came from above. Dicky looked up.
Mr Murphy had scrambled up, and was leaning
over the tree-top rim.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Misther Fanshawe, there’s no call for fightin’.
I’ll come down and settle me account peaceful
wid Billy Croom. I’ll go wid him quiet, for
I’m sure to be cocht <i>any</i>how, and he may as
well have the hundred pound as another. Aisy,
now, Mr Fanshawe, and listen to me. I’ll go
wid Billy on one condijion.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s that?” asked Mr Fanshawe, glad
to be done with the business.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That you take hould of Con Cogan’s arm
over there, and hould him till I ax you to loose
him, for I’m powerful anxious to say a word
to him before I goes to prizon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Right!” said Dicky, stepping over to where
Con stood and taking hold of his arm.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I ax you, sir,” said Mr Murphy, “not to loose
him till I say when.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Right!” said Mr Fanshawe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now,” said Mr Murphy, whipping a frightful-looking
old horse pistol into view and levelling
it at the head of Billy Croom, who stood right
at the bottom of the tree, “now that all’s settled.
I’m going to have a word wid me friend, Billy.
Move the hundredth part of an inch, y’ widge-faced
houn’, and your brains go on the grass.
Misther Fanshawe, will yiz ax the young lady
to go away beyant and shut her eyes and ears?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go quick!” cried Dicky, and he had not to
repeat his words. “Hi, you scoundrel, stop it!
You’re not going to shoot the man.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr Fanshawe,” went on the man in possession
of affairs, “you’ve give your word—this is
betune Billy and me, man to man. Billy Croom,
have I thrumped your ace, or have I not?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Billy was a very brave man, but he knew
the infernal devil in the tree, and his utter recklessness
when moved by whisky or rage.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You have,” said Billy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You came afther me for gowld, and I’m
goin’ to give yiz lead,” said Mr Murphy, “if
yiz as much as blinks wan eye before I lays down
me conditions of war. They’ll be hard, Billy
Croom, but, begob! they’ll be better than
hell.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Dicky, holding Con by the sleeve, looked on
fascinated. Intuition told him that Murphy
would kill the man under him, if the man under
him moved so much as a finger, for there was
that in Murphy’s face which was beyond the earth.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s you afther?” asked Croom, whose
breath was coming hard.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Strip!” said the other—“all but your
britches and brogues; I’ll lave you those for
dacency sake.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll be——if I do!” said Croom.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve said it wanst, I’ll say it twice, and if
I say it three times, I’ll <i>shut</i>—strip!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Croom stripped.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shut your eyes,” cried Dicky, and a voice
came from the wood:</p>

<p class='c013'>“They’re shut.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now,” said Mr Murphy to the half-naked
figure before him, “I’ll give yiz a chanst. I’m
goin’ to count five; at the fifth sthroke I’ll fire
if there’s a speck of yiz to be seen. Use your
legs—Wan—two—three—four——Mr Fanshawe,
sir!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Did yiz happen to see a party be the name
of Billy Croom around here anywhere in the
neebourhood to-day?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I did,” said Mr Fanshawe, “but he seems
to have gone.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Faith,” said Mr Murphy, putting his leg
over the edge of his fortress and scrambling down,
“he’s left his clothes behint him.” He
approached Mr Fanshawe and the trembling
Con. “There’s a lady in the wood, sir, and
maybe you’ll be escorthin’ her home. Good-mornin’,
Con Cogan, I have a word to say with
you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t lave me with him, sir,” implored
Con, “or it’s me brains he’ll be blowin’ out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t you be afear’d, sir,” said Paddy;
“sure, he hasn’t any brains to blow. I’m not
goin’ to hurt a feather of him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I can’t stay here all day,” said Mr
Fanshawe; “you must settle your differences
between you. What are you going to do?
The police will have you, sure. Why don’t
you get out of the country?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure, where could I go?” said Mr Murphy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go to America. Here’s a couple of sovereigns
for you; and, see here, if you’ll make up your
mind to cut the country I’ll help. Apply to me
at No. 10<span class='fss'>A</span> Merrion Square, Dublin, and I’ll pay
your passage, and give you a fiver to start you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure, what could I do in Amerika?” said Mr
Murphy, pocketing the coins without a word of
thanks.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do? Why, go on the stock exchange—no,
go into politics, that’s your true position in life.
You waste your time here. Well, I’m off—good-day.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-day to yiz,” replied the other. “Sure,
it’s you I’d like to have at me elbow in a row.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, I think you’re able to look after yourself;”
said Mr Fanshawe, as he departed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m not a chicken,” replied the other.
“Good-day to yiz. Come, Con, we’ve words
to say to wan another.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“O Dicky,” said Violet, when—having found
each other by hallooing—they pressed their lips
together, “I’m so frightened. Has he shot
him?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No,” replied Mr Fanshawe, chuckling, “but
he’s done nearly as bad. Come on, and let’s
find the road; it’s half-past twelve, and that
confounded luncheon will be kept waiting for us
again.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch34' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXXIV <br /> <br /> MR MURPHY IN EXCELSIS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“Now, Misther Cogan,” said Paddy, when the
last glimpse of Mr Fanshawe had vanished
amidst the trees, “a word in your ear.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Paddy,” said Con Cogan, who was white to his
lips, and licking them, “you may b’lave me or
not, but it wasn’t I set Billy Croom on to yiz.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who said you did?” asked Paddy. “Who
said Con Cogan ever went back on a friend?
Show me the man that siz it, and I’ll show you
his liver on the pint of a stick.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Con Cogan would have much preferred Paddy
to have stormed at him. You see, he knew his
man.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And now that we’ve finished the parlymentaries,”
said Mr Murphy, “we’ll get to bizness.
Into the ould tree wid you, and fitch me the
powther horn, the bu’lets and the waddin’, for
I’m goin’ huntin’.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Paddy, sure, y’ ain’t goin’ to shut me?”
asked Con. He looked sick, and no blame to
him, for it is always an unpleasant question
when one has to put it to another man.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shut you?” said Mr Murphy, with fine
contempt, which Con felt to be a horrible simulation.
“Shut <i>you</i>—what’s set you cockin’ yourself
up wid the idea you was worth powther
and shot? Into the tree wid yiz, and do me
biddin’.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Con, relieved not at all, climbed into the tree,
and Mr Murphy turned his attention to the
clothes left behind him by Billy Croom. He
searched the pockets of the coat—found nothing
in them; then, taking off his own coat, he put
on Croom’s.</p>

<p class='c013'>It didn’t fit. In fact, a seam of the shoulder
frankly burst when Mr Murphy put his powerful
triceps in action stooping down to pick up the
old hunting cap which Billy, by the directions
of the powers above, had discarded with the
clothes.</p>

<p class='c013'>With the cap on his head and the hunting-coat
on his back, Mr Murphy made a figure
sufficiently bizarre. There remained the whip,
which he picked up, and the spurs, which he let
lie.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Here’s the powther and the balls,” said
Con Cogan, lowering himself down from the tree.
“Glory be to God, Paddy, what are yiz dressin’
yourself out in thim things for?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m goin’ huntin’,” said Mr Murphy, putting
the powder and balls in the tail pocket of his
coat. “Put me old coat into the tree and come
back to me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Con did as he was bid.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now,” said Mr Murphy, pointing to the
spurs, “kneel down wid you and put thim spurs
on me boots.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Con knelt down and proceeded to do as he
was directed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What for are you puttin’ spurs on when
you haven’t a horse?” asked Con, as he buckled
the straps of the spurs.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I haven’t a horse, but I have a dunkey.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where is he?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll show you him in a minit.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Con, having fixed the spurs, stood up.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now,” said Mr Murphy, putting the pistol
in the breast of his coat and clutching the whip
in one hand, “turn your back to me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is it me brains you’re going to blow out?”
asked the trembling Con, who, for all Paddy’s
seemingly amiable mood, knew that something
unpleasant was in store for him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Turn your back,” replied the other. “Sure,
it’s a schollar of Thrinity one would think you
were to-day with all your talk about brains.
Turn your back.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Con did as he was bidden, and the next moment
Mr Murphy was on his back.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now you know where I keeps me dunkey,”
said Mr Murphy, who had mounted pick-a-back.
“Now you know why I put on me spurs. Jay
up round the oak till I thries your paces—jay
up.” He struck with his spurs, the rowels of
which entered Con’s thighs, and backwards with
his whip, the butt of which struck Con’s western
extremity. Con shouted with the pain.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t start brayin’ too soon,” said Mr
Murphy, “for it’s your wind you’ll be wantin’
before I’ve done with you—you dhirty houn’.
Thank the Vargin it’s a dunkey I’ve made of
you and not a corpse. Jay up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Con jayed up. Round the oak he went at
a trot and round again.</p>

<p class='c013'>The genius of Mr Murphy had unconsciously
struck a vein of pure gold.</p>

<p class='c013'>Con was an exceedingly powerful man, but
nearly all his strength lay in his legs. Like a
certain English writer of comic verse, now dead,
he had “thighs like a grasshopper’s.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Murphy had discovered in a fit of caprice
Con’s true function and office in life.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jay up!” cried the rider. “That’s not
bad, but trot more even.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let up wid them spurs, for the love of
hiven, and I’ll trot as you want!” cried the
steed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wo!” answered the rider.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What are yiz afther now?” said Con.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothin’,” replied the rider, who had taken
the pistol from his breast, and was examining
the cap on it, with the infernal grin on his face
broadened, as though the weapon were a joke
he was reading in the pages of a comic paper.</p>

<p class='c013'>What horrid thing was about to happen,
who can say, when a brilliant thought passing
through the brain of Mr Murphy, turned his grin
into a whistle. He thrust the pistol back into
his breast.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Set me down,” said he.</p>

<p class='c013'>Con did so with alacrity.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I was on the pint of blowin’ the roof off your
head,” said Mr Murphy, “but, I’ve changed
me decison; at least, I <i>b’lave</i> I have. You
trots well and you ain’t spavined: there’s on’y
one pint I ain’t sure about—can yiz bray?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Can I what?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bray like an ass,” replied the other, taking
the pistol from his breast.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Put it back!” cried Con. “Sure, I’ll bray
like a hundred asses, if yiz give me the word.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sthrike up, thin.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Con brayed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Murphy put his pistol back.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s not so bad,” said he, “but it’s not
parfect. Stick out your head, rowl up your lip,
now—let fly.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The noise was repeated.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Faith, your voice has saved your life,”
said Mr Murphy. “Turn your back.” In a
second he had mounted pick-a-back again.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, aff we go!” cried Mr Murphy. “Jay
up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where to?” asked Con.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Castle Knock—where else?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure, Paddy, you wouldn’t be ridin’ me into
the town!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jay up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure, I’ll never be able to show me face in
the county agin.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jay up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The spurs struck home so hard that the steed
nearly unseated his rider with the bound he gave.
Then, at a trot, they started for Castle Knock.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Murphy knew his populace.</p>

  <h2 id='ch35' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXXV <br /> <br /> INFLUENZA</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“Bob,” said Doris next morning, “Miss Lestrange
has got the influenza.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How do you know?” asked Bob.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve been to her room, and she’s lying in bed
crying. Bob!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s not the influenza.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What are you driving at?” asked Bob.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Promise not to tell, and you’ll be in it too,”
said Doris.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I promise—go ahead. What are you driving
at?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She’s going away.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“To be married.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Heu!” said Bob in a disgusted tone.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But that’s not all,” went on Doris. “She’s
going with Mr Fanshawe, and nobody knows
about it, only me and you and she and Patsy.
She told me if we were good we might see her off;
they are going at two o’clock in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My eye!” said Bob, lighting up. “They
ain’t running away, are they?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They are. They’re running away from the
old General and Mr Boxall—going to Dublin to
be married. They’re going in the dogcart from
the stable-yard—but, mind you, don’t say a
word to any one.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What do you take me for?” said Bob.
“I say, Doris!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wouldn’t it be prime if the old General
chased them?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t!” said Doris.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I was only thinking of him running after
them with his great red face, an’ shouting to
them to stop,” said Bob. He was kneeling on
the window-seat of the schoolroom and looking
out over the park. “I left that motor-car in
the hall yesterday,” went on Bob, “and he hit
his toe against it and sent it skidding across
the floor, and he said, ‘Confound those children!
they’re always in the way when they’re not
wanted, they or their beastly toys.’ I was
leaning over the banisters and I jolly nearly
dropped a marble on his head. Who’s that
coming?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s Doctor O’Flaherty,” said Doris, kneeling
up also on the window-seat and looking out at
the car which was coming up the drive at a trot.</p>

<p class='c013'>The car drew up at the door, and Dr O’Flaherty
of Tullagh, an old gentleman with grey side-whiskers,
a clean-shaved physician’s mouth, and
a humorous grey eye, descended and went up
the steps.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, James,” said the doctor, as the door
opened to him, “and what’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Her ladyship is poorly, sir, and there’s a
houseful of influenza,” replied James, who was
not an optimist. “Which will you see first, sir,
the influenza or her ladyship?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Seniores priores!</i>” said the country doctor
cheerily, as he took his stethoscope from his hat,
hung his hat up and divested himself of his overcoat.
“Her ladyship, James, by all means.”</p>

<p class='c013'>At this moment the door of the library opened
and General Grampound came out.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I beg your pardon,” said General Grampound,
“are you the doctor?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am,” said the practitioner.</p>

<p class='c013'>“May I have a word with you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“With pleasure!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The General led the way into the library.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My ward, Miss Lestrange, is down with the
influenza,” said General Grampound.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am told it’s in the house,” said Dr O’Flaherty.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I believe the devil’s in the house!” burst
out the General. “I had intended leaving by
the train this morning from Tullagh, and now
this turns up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Influenza has that habit,” said the doctor.
“It leaves its card on you in the most unexpected
manner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t believe it’s influenza at all!” broke
out the General, “and that’s just what I want to
talk to you about. I believe it’s malingering.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“O ho!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir. I have reasons to suspect that
I am a dupe; however, I await your diagnosis.
Shall I show you to the door of my ward’s room?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Seniores priores</i>,” replied the other rather
stiffly. “Her ladyship first, if you please—thank
you, I know the house.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He slipped out of the room; James was waiting
for him in the hall.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And who is the old gentleman at all, James?”
asked Dr O’Flaherty, as they passed down the
corridor to Lady Seagrave’s room.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That was General Grampound, doctor,”
replied James.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Faith, he looks it,” replied the other, as he
tapped at the bedroom door.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lady Seagrave was sitting up in bed, with
a lace cap on her head, looking very grim and
sombre.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come in,” said she. “Oh, that’s you—I
expected you an hour ago—sit down. There’s
no use talking to me,” added she, with a blaze
of irritation, “for I’m deaf.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Faith, you’ve been a long time finding that
out,” murmured O’Flaherty.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It seized me yesterday morning,” went on
the old woman. “I was quite right when I
got up; I could hear what my maid said when
she brought me my tea, and then it came on.
Why don’t you answer me? You sit there
without moving your lips like an image.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hum, hum!” said O’Flaherty, whose temper
and bluntness were proverbial, “you’ve been
deaf in your ears and deaf in your senses all the
time <i>I’ve</i> known you. Deaf! Faith, it’s a
megaphone, not a trumpet, they’ll want to raise
you out of your coffin with when the time
comes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There you are!” said Lady Seagrave. “I
can tell what you say by the movements of your
lips. It is not influenza—some doctors seem
to have influenza on the brain.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Faith, and that’s a disease you’ll never have,”
said the practitioner, taking a snuff-box from
his pocket and a pinch.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lady Seagrave objected to tobacco, but she
did not mind a person taking snuff in her presence.
She was of that day.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You think because there is influenza in the
house I must have it. I haven’t; I expect it’s
a little cold. However, I haven’t sent for you
to tinker over my ears, but to see a patient.
I have a guest who is down with influenza—a
Mr Boxall, a Member of Parliament—but he
refuses to see a doctor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then,” said O’Flaherty, “he must have
more sense in him than the ordinary Members
of Parliament.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know—it’s very foolish of him, but he
is not going to pursue his foolishness under my
roof. He must be seen.”</p>

<p class='c013'>O’Flaherty nodded his head.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You had better go and see him now,” said
her ladyship, “and not waste any more of your
time on me. If he is very bad you can tell
James, and he will let me know, and you’d better
call again to-morrow. Good-day.”</p>

<p class='c013'>She pulled a big bell-rope beside her bed to
summon James, who was lingering in the passage,
and the doctor with an old-fashioned bow to
his patient and a grin on his lips left the room.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The man’s a fool,” murmured the old lady
to herself, as she settled down in her bed, “but
he’s respectful—the sort of country doctor I
remember when doctors called themselves apothecaries
and knew their proper places.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“This room, sir,” said James. He knocked
at the door next to Lady Seagrave’s.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come in,” said a woman’s voice, and
O’Flaherty found himself in the presence of a
pretty girl, fully dressed, seated in a basket armchair
and busily engaged in tearing up letters.
A dressing-bag half stuffed with things stood
on a chair.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c013'>Half an hour later, coming downstairs, Dr
O’Flaherty met General Grampound in the hall.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, doctor,” said the General, drawing
him into the library, “what’s the diagnosis?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just a chill.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Will she be able to leave here to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She will,” replied the other, with a twinkle
in his eye; “and, what’s more, she’s anxious to
go.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hum! Have you seen my friend Boxall?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No,” replied the doctor, “but he saw me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How do you know?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Through the keyhole, for he bolted his door.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I can’t make out what’s wrong with the
man,” said General Grampound.</p>

  <h2 id='ch36' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXXVI <br /> <br /> PREPARATIONS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“Mr Fanshawe!”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was just before the first dinner gong, and
Mr Fanshawe was in the billiard-room alone
practising strokes. He was horribly nervous
and depressed. That nervous depression had
seized him which sometimes comes as the herald
of disaster, sometimes simply from over-wrought
nerves.</p>

<p class='c013'>Only seven hours or so lay between him and
the great moment of his life.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had done everything that could be done.
Larry Lyburn had fallen in with everything,
and had declared himself willing to carry out
instructions to the minutest detail; he had
received a sovereign on account, and the promise
of two more on starting. Fly-by-night, a great
roan mare, had been inspected and approved.
Mr Fanshawe was to drive, and Larry to sit
behind.</p>

<p class='c013'>That the job would most likely lose Larry his
place never occurred to that individual, but it
did to Mr Fanshawe, and he had stated his intention
of taking Mr Lyburn into his service, and
pensioning him, if need be, should trouble ensue,
to which statement of intention Larry had
replied: “Yes, sor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Despite all this Mr Fanshawe felt nervous.
He would have felt more nervous still had he
known that Larry had spent some of his largesse
on a bottle of whisky.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr Fanshawe!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hullo!” said Mr Fanshawe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s no one here?” said Doris; “that’s
all right. I have a note for you. It’s from her,”
said Doris, as Mr Fanshawe opened the note.</p>

<p class='c021'>“Courage, darling—I am quite prepared. I
will be ready dressed waiting at two. I will
come down to the hall just as the big clock
strikes.—Ever,  V.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Fanshawe read.</p>

<p class='c013'>“She’s told me about it,” said Doris; “and
I’m going to see you off, and Bob’s coming too.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good gracious!” said Mr Fanshawe, “is
it safe?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Quite; we won’t make a bit of noise. No
one sleeps on our landing but Biddy, and she sleeps
in the room with Selina, and <i>nothing</i> wakes her.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right,” said Mr Fanshawe, who, on
second thoughts, felt rather pleased that the
children’s innocent presence should lend a colour
to the thing. “But mind and don’t breathe a
word to any one; be in the big hall at two.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll be there,” said Doris, with the air of
a conspirator. “Now I must go, lest any one
suspects—there’s the dressing gong.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“So it is,” said Mr Fanshawe.</p>

<p class='c013'>He left the library and went to his room,
where Patsy had just brought his hot water.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Everything is going on all right, Patsy, I
suppose?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir; everything is fixed now, and Larry
will have the yard strawed be wan.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Right!” said Mr Fanshawe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Have you heard of Paddy Murphy, sir?”
asked Patsy, as he was leaving the room.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No—what about him?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He rode into Castle Knock yesterday, on
Con Cogan——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“On what?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Faith, on me uncle,” said Patsy, “for Con’s
me uncle, and a bad, black baste of a man he is.
Con gave Paddy away, and Paddy cocht him an’
saddled and bridled him, so they say, and now
he’s ridin’ him over the country-side, clane cracked
wid the whisky. He rode up to the inn at Castle
Knock yesterday, afther they’d chased him, wid
Billy Croom’s coat on his back and spurs on
and all, and he mounted on Con like a dunkey,
and Con brayin’; and he pulled out a handful of
gowld and stood trate to every man he met;
and they say you could hear the hullaballoo at
Castle Grange—the people shoutin’ and cheerin’
Paddy, and he mounted on Con, and ridin’ him
up and down the street. Thin he bought two
bottles of whisky, and off he wint at a canter;
and they say he’s highwaying people and cuttin’
up the divil’s own shine on the roads.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good Lord!” said Mr Fanshawe, “are there
no police at all in this country?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They’re all beyant at the cattle dhrivin’,”
said Patsy. “But, sure, a ridgment of police
wouldn’t take Paddy whin the whisky’s got him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“See here, Patsy,” said Mr Fanshawe, “I
mayn’t have time to say it later on, if you get
into any trouble over this affair, you know
who’s your friend. And I’m going to take you
into my service anyhow, but I’ll arrange all that
later on, when the row is over. Here’s a sovereign
for you. I’m not going to give you any
more at present, for you’d only be spending it
on rubbish; but I’ll give you good wages when
I take you on. And, see here, Patsy, you’d
better get hold of that ear-trumpet to-morrow
morning, when we are gone, and take the cork out.
We don’t want the old lady to be deaf for ever.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Dinner was a most trying function. To have
to sit at the same table with a man who has
called you a hound is somewhat of a tax on
the appetite, even though the man is your uncle.
After dinner came a game of billiards with Uncle
Molyneux.</p>

<p class='c013'>Coming out of the billiard-room at half-past
ten, Mr Fanshawe heard General Grampound’s
abusive voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>The old gentleman was saying: “You’ll tell
the groom to be here to time, so as to allow two
hours for getting to the station, and the luggage-cart
had better be here at six sharp.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir,” replied Patsy’s voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Fanshawe passed into the dining-room
for a whisky and soda. He consumed three on
the principle of the camel who has to face the
desert.</p>

<p class='c013'>At half-past eleven he went to his room.</p>

<p class='c013'>At twelve, with two or three exceptions, the
household was snoring.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch37' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXXVII <br /> <br /> FLIGHT</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>He heard the clock strike twelve. There were
two mortal hours yet to be consumed in idleness.
He could do nothing, and the whole of his future
happiness was in the hands of Patsy and Larry
Lyburn. He sought for and found a rank old
briar root—true friend in the past on many a
moor, at many a covert side, filled it with cut
cavendish, and lit it.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was only taking a hunting kit-bag. It
was already packed, but he unpacked it, and
packed it again to kill time. In the midst of
these occupations the clock struck one.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was something sinister in the extreme
silence of the house. One could not but fancy
subterfuge in it; and under its cloak armed surprise.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Fanshawe, seated on his bed, smoking
and staring at the hunting kit-bag now stuffed,
locked and strapped, heard in imagination the
banging of doors, the screaming of maid-servants,
and the raucous voice of his uncle crying, “Stop
them!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then he began to find fault with himself for
not ordering a special train. A wire had come
that afternoon from the General Manager of
the Great Midland of Ireland, saying that the
express from Carlow would stop at Tullagh as
directed, but, all the same, a special would have
been safer, for, should anything happen to delay
him on the drive to Tullagh the express would
not wait.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is in this way that men discover holes in
their armour at the last moment, just before
the fight, a faulty string in their banjo when
they are on the platform, and the audience
is preparing to wreathe itself in smiles at the
comic song.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Fanshawe went to the window and peeped
out.</p>

<p class='c013'>The moon, just after the full, was swinging in
a cloudless sky, the park lay under the moon
covered with a thin winter mist. The great
funereal masses of the woods, the distant hills
like a troop of gigantic horsemen cloaked, and
riding under the night, made a picture after the
heart of Gustave Doré.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Fanshawe looked at his watch. It was
ten minutes to two. He took the hunting
kit-bag in one hand and the solitary candle in
the other and left the room.</p>

<p class='c013'>The house was solidly constructed, and the
stair carpets were thick, so he could move without
making the least sound. As he came down the
last steps to the hall the place looked vast, and
the men in armour interested and not too surely
amiable spectators of the scene.</p>

<p class='c013'>A small figure stood at the foot of the stairs.
It was Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is all right, Patsy?” whispered Mr Fanshawe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I b’lave so, sir,” said Patsy in the same tone
of voice. “I slipped out quarter of an hour ago,
and Larry, he’s strawed the yard, and he was
openin’ the coach-house dure to get the cart
out. He’s done everything all right, but he’s
rockin’ drunk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good heavens!” said Dicky.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, he’ll drive all right, sir,” said Patsy.
“Drunk or sober is all the same to Larry, as
long as he’s got the ribbons in his hand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A slight sound from above drew Mr Fanshawe’s
attention. It was Doris fully dressed, with a
candle in her hand, and Bob. Bob was making
short slides down the banisters as he came, with
one leg hanging over the hall. It only required
that he should tumble over and break his leg
to precipitate the disaster Mr Fanshawe dimly
felt to be impending.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If he does,” thought Dicky, “I’ll break the
little beast’s neck, to complete the business.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Here we are, Mr Fanshawe,” said Doris in
a joyful whisper, as she and Bob arrived at the
foot of the stairs without accident.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Fanshawe did not answer, he was looking
up. A faint star of light was gliding downwards,
ghostly and glow-worm like. It was Miss
Lestrange dressed in a mole-skin cloak, a travelling
bag in one hand, and a candle in the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Boom—Boom.” The great clock in the
turret was striking two.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m not frightened,” gasped the girl, as Dicky,
forgetting the children and Patsy, clasped her
in his arms, “I’m only nervous.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, then, Patsy,” whispered Mr Fanshawe,
“lead the way with the candle, we have no time
to lose.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy led the way down the corridor to the
kitchen.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve iled them,” said Patsy with a grin as
he slid the bolts back silently of the kitchen
door. “Howld the candle over me shoulder,
Misther Fanshawe, that I may see where Larry is.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Fanshawe did as he was asked. Patsy
turned the key in the lock and opened the door.</p>

<p class='c013'>“O Glory be to God!” said Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>It did not require a candle to light the picture,
the full moon did it.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the middle of the yard, which was deeply
strawed, stood the great old family coach in
which Lady Seagrave took her airings, harnessed
to it were the two stout white coach horses, one
of which, hearing the faint sound of the opening
door, turned its fiddle-shaped head and surveyed
the newcomers with a flickering, subdued whinny.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the straw, face down, arms spread out,
and the moonlight exhibiting the two tarnished
buttons on the back of the old livery coat he
had slipped on, lay Larry.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Great heavens!” said Mr Fanshawe, “look
at the thing he has harnessed!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s got it all muddled wid the whisky, sir,”
whispered Patsy. “There’s nothin’ to be done
but get the dogcart out ourselves and put the old
mare to.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He gave Larry a kick with his foot, and Larry
gave a grunt.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s full up,” said Patsy, as though he were
speaking about a decanter.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Couldn’t we go in this thing?” asked Mr
Fanshawe. “I could drive.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s only Larry and the coachman that
can make thim two ould horses go beyond a
walk,” replied Patsy. “Better get the dogcart
out and we’ll put the mare to in no time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Right!” said Mr Fanshawe. “Violet, what
will you do whilst we’re harnessing?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll stand and watch you,” replied she.
“And O Dicky, <i>don’t</i> make a noise.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr Fanshawe,” whispered Doris, “<i>his</i> room
is just above.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know,” replied Mr Fanshawe, in the tone
of a man who is driven to extremity. “Patsy,
you fetch out the mare, I’ll fetch the dogcart
out—that’s the coach-house door, isn’t it?
Bother! the brute has put the bar up—quick, it’s
eight minutes past two.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Whilst Patsy went to fetch the mare, Mr
Fanshawe approached the coach-house door.
Larry, an automaton even in his cups, had done
his work carefully and well, even to barring the
door. He must have done it silently, too.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Fanshawe had just lifted the bar when in
his hurry it slipped from his hands and fell on
the flags with a bang. The straw of the yard
did not reach quite to the coach-house door,
and the sound was loud, and awful as the crack
of doom. Mr Fanshawe removed the bar from
the ground, placed it end up against the wall,
opened the coach-house door and seized upon
the dogcart, which was fortunately shafts towards
the open door. He was wheeling it carefully
out when a window shot open above.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hullo!” cried Mr Boxall’s voice, “what’s
this?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s the Tullagh mail-cart, sir, broke down
and come to borrow a horse,” cried Patsy, who
was leading Fly-by-night out of the stable.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What cart?” asked Mr Boxall. But Patsy
did not answer; he had darted into the harness
room and returned with the collar on one shoulder
and dragging the harness after him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Quick, sir!” cried Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Fanshawe did not need to be told. He
had just passed the collar over the mare’s head
when another window shot up.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hullo! hullo! what’s this?” came General
Grampound’s voice, “what’s this? What the
devil are you doing down there? Why, hi!
Richard! Violet! God bless my soul, Boxall,
quick, they’re making away. Raise the house.”
His head vanished from the window.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t stop to answer him, sir,” cried Patsy.
“Hould this strap wan minit—wo, you baste!—Don’t
stop to answer him, sir. I’ve tied
their dure handles togither wid a lingth of whipcord
so’s they can’t get out till some one lets
’em. Lift your tail, y’ divil—listen to ’em, they’re
fair thrapped.”</p>

<p class='c013'>From the house could be heard the sounds
that spoke of bedroom doors being hammered
upon and kicked against, and the screaming
of women wakened from their sleep, and the
barking of Lady Molyneux’s pugs.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whin I saw Larry was drunk, I slipped upstairs
wid the string and fastened their dure
handles together,” said Patsy, as he laboured
away at the straps. “Help me wid the trace,
sir—it’s hitched. Faith, we’ve beaten thim;
one more strap, and we’ve done. Quick, sir, in
wid the lady—they’re out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The sounds upstairs had ceased.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jump into the carriage, children,” cried
Violet, kissing Doris wildly, “and hide!” She
opened the door of the old family coach, and
the children popped in.</p>

<p class='c013'>The next moment she was half lifted, half
pushed into the dogcart. The bags were shot
in, Mr Fanshawe took the reins. Patsy clambered
up behind and they started.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let her have her mouth, sir,” said Patsy,
as they turned out of the yard, “and don’t
press her till she warms to her work. We’ve
time and plenty, for it’ll take an hour before the
ould Gineral kicks Larry sober. Mind the post, sir—that’s
right—but mind the turnin’ at the drive.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They passed the turning safely, then down
the moonlit drive, Fly-by-night dancing with
her own shadow in the moonlight, then through
the park gates and the sleeping village of Castle
Knock they went, the mare’s hoofs ringing on
the hard high-road to Tullagh.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c013'>“I say, this is a go!” said little Lord Gawdor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hush!” said Doris. “We can slip out
when they put the carriage back in the coach-house.”
She pulled the carriage door to, and they
listened. They had not to listen long. Hurried
steps came through the kitchen, and then Mr
Boxall’s voice and the General’s.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They’ve gone in the dogcart. What’s this
carriage doing. Hi you, sir,”—the sound of a
kick—“Hi you, sir—he’s drunk—Hi, you
drunken beast,”—kick, kick.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lit up,” came Larry’s voice. “Lave me be,
or I’ll kick the stuffin’ out of you when I get on
me pins. Whoa-up—what’s the matter?
Gineral—why, it’s you. I wasn’t dhrunk, I’s
only aslape—what do you say—Misther Fanshawe?
Why, he’s dew be this to be off to
Tullagh to kitch the train.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Up you get,” came the General’s voice, “on
to your legs—up on the box with you—there
you are, take the reins, drive for all you’re worth,
and mark you, if you stop before we overtake
them, I’ll thrash you within an inch of your life.
You can find the road to Tullagh, can you, you
half-drunken beast?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Arrah, get in wid you,” came Larry’s voice
from the box—“in wid you, and I’ll drive you to
the divil (hic)—in you get. Tullagh is it?—Right
y’are.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The General bounced in and shut the door,
and the old coach started with a jerk and took
the corner of the stable-yard, just shaving overset
and destruction.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Boxall, running to the corner, saw the
vehicle in the moonlight making full speed
down the avenue; he saw the General’s head
suddenly protruded through the right window,
and heard his voice, borne on the night breeze,
shouting, “Stop! hi, stop! the d—d thing
is full of children!” and Larry’s voice, “Aisy—sit
aisy, we’ll be afther overtaking thim in a
minit.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Who he would be “afther overtaking” must
have been a very dark question in Mr Lyburn’s
mind, obsessed as it was with whisky and the
two ideas—Tullagh and speed.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch38' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXXVIII <br /> <br /> THE OFF HUB</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>As the dogcart left the park gates, a remark
that the coachman had made to Larry Lyburn
that morning recurred to Patsy’s mind.</p>

<p class='c013'>Larry had drawn the cart out of the coach-house
for inspection. Dan, the coachman, had
been passing, and Dan, who had the eye of an
eagle for faults, had made a remark on the hub
of the off wheel.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s a crack in the hub of the off wheel
you could put your nose into,” said Dan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Crack in your eye,” said Larry; only it
wasn’t “eye” he said.</p>

<p class='c013'>That was all. Dan passed on with the bucket
of water he was carrying, and Larry turned the
dogcart cushions to air in the bit of winter sun
that was peeping over the stable roof.</p>

<p class='c013'>Patsy, who had overheard the remark and
Larry’s reply, scarcely gave the matter a second
thought. He no more doubted the opinion of
Larry on a hub than a country doctor would
doubt the opinion of Sir Frederick Treves on an
appendix. That is to say, Larry in his sober
senses. The question troubling the mind of
Patsy now was whether Larry’s senses were in
a sober frame when he flung his diagnosis as to
the condition of the off hub at Dan’s head in
the form of an unprintable retort. In other
words and plainer English, he was wondering
at what o’clock had Larry begun at the
whisky.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Fanshawe had given Patsy the sovereign
on account to hand to Larry the previous night,
and now Patsy remembered, with a chill at the
heart, having seen little Billy Meehan, an anæmic
sprite of seven, a hanger-on and errand-runner
at the Castle Knock inn, passing the kitchen
door quite early that morning carrying something
wrapped up in a cloth, something that
might have been a bottle of spirits.</p>

<p class='c013'>“O Dicky,” sighed Miss Lestrange, “is it a
dream—are we really together? I can’t believe
it is true.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They had passed the sleeping village and the
row of poplar trees at its entrance, and the road
was ringing to the merry sound of Fly-by-night’s
hoofs.</p>

<p class='c013'>They passed Barn-End, a tiny hamlet, a spore
cast-off by Castle Knock; lying two miles and a
half towards Tullagh.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Only a bit over tin miles now, sir,” said
Patsy from behind.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ten Irish miles,” said Mr Fanshawe, looking
at his watch; “and it’s now twenty-five minutes
past two; we’ve lots of time. There’s no fear of
those two old carriage horses overtaking us,
is there, Patsy?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, sir; but if the General’s able to kick
sinse into Larry they won’t be far behind. Larry
can make ’em go at a gallop, and wanst they’re
started they’ll go all day.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s Castle Connell to the right, sir,” said
Patsy after a long interval broken only by the
eloquence of Fly-by-night’s hoofs. “Six miles
and a quarter, as the crow flies, from Glen Druid.
We’re near half-way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Patsy reminds me of those advertisements
one sees on the railway lines,” whispered Violet,
snuggling up close to Mr Fanshawe. “You know
the ones, Beecham’s pills, twenty miles to London.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Are you warm, dear?” asked her companion.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Quite,” she murmured, drawing the mole-skin
cloak more tightly around her.</p>

<p class='c013'>The great idle moon lolling over the hills
cast Fly-by-night’s shadow before her. She
had warmed to her work now, and was going
like a dream under the hand of a master and
lover of horses.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! look at the moon,” sighed Violet, turning
for a moment in her seat and looking backwards.
“I wish this could last forever.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I say,” cried out Dicky, heedless of this wish,
which the gods no doubt had overheard, “the
cart’s going a bit rocky. Anything wrong with
it, do you think, Patsy?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I hope not, sir,” said Patsy. “I heard Dan,
the coachman say something to Larry about
wan of the ‘hubs.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What did he say?” asked Mr Fanshawe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He was going across the yard wid a bucket
of water, and Larry was clanin’ the cart, and Dan,
he says, ‘Larry,’ says he, ‘what are you doin’?’
‘Clanin’ the cart,’ says Larry. ‘And what are
you clanin’ it for?’ he asks. ‘To make it tidy,’
says Larry. ‘Sure, get off to some other job,’
says Dan. ‘The ould cart has to go to the coach-builders
for there’s a crack in that “hub” you
could stick your nose in; and where’s your eyes?
says he; ‘get off and be doin’ your harness, and
let the coach-builders clane the trap if it’s worth
clanin’, for it’s my opinion, he says, ‘it ought to
have been condimned long ago. Lighting fires is
all it’s fit for.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good heavens!” said Mr Fanshawe. “Why
didn’t you tell me this before?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure, I trusted Larry, sir,” said Patsy.
“He knows more thin Dan about the traps and
the harness any day in the——Holy Mary!
there’s the wheel goin’.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hold tight,” cried Mr Fanshawe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’re over,” cried Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>A perfectly superfluous statement delivered
from the ditch where he lay with Miss Lestrange’s
dressing-bag on his chest. You could have heard
the sound of the smash half a mile down the
silent road.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c013'>“I’m all right,” murmured the girl. “Where
am I? O Dicky!”</p>

<p class='c013'>She was sitting on the road against the hedge
bank. The broken-down dogcart with one wheel
off lay before her, also Fly-by-night on her side,
with Patsy seated on the mare’s head.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s all right,” said Mr Fanshawe, “it’s only
a smash up. Nothing matters as long as you
aren’t hurt.”</p>

<p class='c013'>She gazed at the ruins before her, and took
in the whole extent of the catastrophe, as did
Mr Fanshawe. The position was horrible. Any
moment the pursuer might arrive, and then what
was to be done? He could not fight his uncle,
there was nothing possible except ignominious
capitulation. When you are successful in an
affair of this kind you are an object of admiration
to every one, especially the women. To run
away with a woman is the only excuse for a
man ever running away; let the woman be
subtracted and the excuse is gone, and the man
is an object of derision to every one—especially
the women.</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Lestrange felt this as keenly as her
companion.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dicky,” she cried, “I’m all right. Do
something. Get the horse up. Is the dogcart
<i>quite</i> broken?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Quite,” said Mr Fanshawe. He unbuckled
the straps of the harness, freed the broken shafts,
and got Fly-by-night on her feet with Patsy’s help.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Patsy,” said Mr Fanshawe, “isn’t there any
place round here we could get a cart?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nowhere, sir,” said Patsy; “the nearest
farm is five mile away, and the only cart you
could get there is a hay-cart.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Fanshawe climbed on the bank. There
was not a habitation to be seen anywhere, fields,
fields, and nothing but fields, waste lands, clumps
of trees. The high-road to Castle Knock looked
like a twisted white ribbon. There was not
even a breath of wind, not a sound under the
silent moon. He could hear the watch in his
pocket ticking. He took it out, it pointed to
five minutes to three.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How far is it to Tullagh, Patsy?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seven miles and more,” replied Patsy in a
heart-broken voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’re done,” said Mr Fanshawe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look, sir,” said Patsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was pointing in the direction of Tullagh.
Down the road, towards them, was coming a
reeling object, which, in the moonlight, looked
now like a dromedary, now like a giant.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What on earth is it?” cried Miss Lestrange.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Begob, I don’t know, miss,” replied Patsy,
“but whatever it is, it’s drunk.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch39' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXXIX <br /> <br /> A MAN OF RESOURCE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>That night Mr Murphy and his steed had been
carousing in the cabin of Billy the Rafter, a
gentleman of no occupation, who lived by the
main road half-way between Castle Knock and
Tullagh. Mr Murphy, Con and Billy had been
playing “Spoil Five” with an old greasy pack
of cards, talking politics, and drinking whisky.</p>

<p class='c013'>The events of the day before had placed Mr
Murphy securely and forever on the pedestal
of public admiration.</p>

<p class='c013'>The sight of Billy Croom starting valiantly
in pursuit of him followed by the sight of Billy
Croom after the encounter, stripped of everything
but his breeches and boots and going home
in a sack, had left an undying impression on
the public mind. The reduction of Con Cogan
to a beast of burthen had completed the business.
The whole affair had an artistic completeness,
more especially when viewed by a people possessed
at once of a sense of humour and an abhorrence
of law.</p>

<p class='c013'>So there had been whisky galore for Mr Murphy,
and cheers—a compound not unpleasant, but
apt to be unsettling to the mind.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was long after two in the morning when
the card-party broke up, and Mr Murphy, rising
rather unsteadily to his feet, prepared to return
to his arboreal home.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s a fine night,” said Billy the Rafter, as
he accompanied his visitors to the door; “faith,
you could see to rade print be the light of the
moon. Keep your eye out for the police, Paddy,
for they do be sayin’ wind of it all has got over
to Shepherd’s Cross.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“P’leece!” said Mr Murphy with fine contempt,
producing the horse pistol and inspecting the
cap on it. “Who’s you talkin’ to? Now thin,
Con—Billy give me a leg up, for the whisky’s
got under me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Con, obedient to the superior will, as a donkey
turned his back; Billy the Rafter gave the
required leg up, and Mr Murphy mounted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“’Night to you, Billy,” cried the mounted one.
“Jay up. Put your best fut foremost, for it’s
home I ought to have been an hour ago.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let up wid thim spurs,” grumbled Con, as
he took the high-road; “aisy wid that whip,
don’t be moidherin’ me, or it’s into the ditch
we’ll be; for it’s a double load I’m carryin’ wid
you on me back and the whisky aboard.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Faith,” confessed Mr Murphy, “it’s two
moons I’m seein’ meself, and the road looks
twishtin’ like a corkscrew. Musha, but it’s a
glurious night; it calls to me mind the ould
days whin I wint courtin’. Jay up, y’ divil, an’
keep the road.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hould on,” said Con, who had better eyes
in his head than his rider. “What’s that foreninst
us on the road?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Murphy, shutting one eye, made out a
black mass on the road ahead of them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s a cart broke down,” said he; “where
there’s a smash-up there’s always pickin’s.
Jay up—we’ll lind them our ’sistance.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was the dogcart—a horrible ruin, one wheel
off and shafts broken. Patsy holding Fly-by-night
(name of satire) by the bridle, Miss Lestrange
seated, like a young and beautiful Niobe, in a
mole-skin cloak, on the hedge bank, and Dicky
Fanshawe trying to console her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hulloo, hulloo,” cried Mr Murphy, as he
trotted up, “what’s the truble wid ye? Why,
glory be to God, it’s Mr Fanshawe!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s Murphy!” cried Dicky Fanshawe, a
feeling of hope springing up in his breast, for,
whatever else the ruffian might be, he was a
man of resource, and if there was such a thing
as gratitude in the whole wide world, a
friend.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr Murphy, from his point of vantage, gazed
with a grin at the smashed cart, the weeping girl,
the distracted Mr Fanshawe, and Patsy. Then
touching Con with a spur he rode round the
ruined vehicle and inspected it. Miss Lestrange
noticed with an obfusc sort of horror that Con
obeyed voice and spur just like a horse. The
whole thing felt like a terrible and fantastic
nightmare.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s no time to lose!” cried Dicky, when
Mr Murphy had made his inspection. “The
thing is smashed beyond mending. Murphy, for
heaven’s sake, do you know of a horse and trap
anywhere near? I must get to Tullagh by four
to catch the mail to Dublin. See here, we are
running away, this young lady and I——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s not a horse and cart nearer than
four miles,” said Murphy; “is there, Con?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Divil a wan,” replied the steed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good Lord!” cried Dicky, “and we’re
being chased. The General is after us in the
carriage—you remember the old gentleman with
the red face?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s afther you, is he, in a carriage?” said
Mr Murphy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He is—he’ll be here any minute.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Con,” cried Mr Murphy, “set me down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now,” cried he, when he was on his feet,
“help me, all of yiz, to clear the rubbage out of
the road.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They bent to their task, and in a minute the
ruined dogcart was tumbled into the ditch and
the road was clear.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Listen!” said Miss Lestrange, who had risen
to her feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>The sound of hoofs and wheels came on the
night air, and far on the road appeared a carriage
rapidly approaching.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, Mr Fanshawe,” said Murphy, whipping
out his old pistol, “this is him, and I’m goin’
to give yiz a carridge to ride in, but you’ve got
to pay for it, begob. One good turn desarves
another. Out wid your money or your life!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, you infernal scoundrel!” cried Dicky.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Out wid it!” cried Murphy—“watch and
chain and all; times is bad, and I’ve no use for
parlymentaries—I’m goin’ to give yiz a carridge
to the station; would you have me play highwayman
with the ould gentleman and let you go
free?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I see,” cried Dicky, who caught the other’s
meaning. “Here you are, if the business has
to be done this way, I’d sooner stand in.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure, I knew you would,” said Mr Murphy,
now thoroughly sober; “you’re a gintleman
to the last button of your wistcoat. Give me
the suverins, take back the notes; they’re no
use to me, bad cess to them! Now the watch
and chain. Thank you kindly. Has the young
lady any movables?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Only this bracelet,” said Violet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Kape it,” said Mr Murphy; “bracelits is
no use to me. Now it’s my turn. Con!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Con presented his back and Mr Murphy
mounted. The carriage was only a few hundred
yards off, and the pair of ruffians, one on the back
of the other, stood square before it on the roadway.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hulloo! hulloo!” cried Larry, reining in.
“What are yiz? Why, it’s Paddy Murphy!”</p>

<p class='c013'>With the stopping of the carriage the door
flew open and General Grampound came out of
the vehicle like a bombshell. He exploded on
the road into unprintable language. Then he
found himself fronting Murphy’s red, grinning
face, and a pistol held within a foot of his head.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wan word out of you and I’ll blow your
skylights off!” cried Murphy.</p>

<p class='c013'>General Grampound’s long army experience
had taught him to know an utterly desperate
ruffian when he met one.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Into the carridge wid you, Mr Fanshawe,”
cried Murphy. “I’m wid yiz, miss,—I won’t
harm the ould gintleman if he keeps a dacent
tongue in his head, but I’m goin’ to give him a
lesson in dancin’—away wid yiz! Good luck,
and send me a piece of the weddin’ ceek.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Patsy, get on the box and come with us,”
cried Mr Fanshawe as he bundled Miss Lestrange
into the carriage and into the arms of Doris and
Little Lord Gawdor, “the children are all right.
Larry will drive them back. I’m very sorry,”
he cried over his shoulder to his uncle; “it’s your
own fault, if you have to walk home. This
scoundrel has taken my watch and chain and
all my money—nearly. I’ll write.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Larry,” cried Mr Murphy as the carriage
drove off.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If you miss the thrain I’ll boot your ribs in
to-morrow mornin’.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Have we time?” gasped Violet Lestrange
with Doris’s arms about her neck.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where are we, Mr Fanshawe?” asked little
Lord Gawdor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t know,” replied Mr Fanshawe, putting
his head out of the window.</p>

<p class='c013'>He looked back. On the moonlight road
Mr Murphy was squatting on his hams with
the old horse pistol levelled straight at General
Grampound.</p>

<p class='c013'>General Grampound was dancing on the
moonlit roadway before Mr Murphy, with all
the grace and agility of a performing elephant.</p>

<p class='c013'>You may think it strange that any consideration
would cause a retired General officer of the
British Army to disgrace the moon by performing
such antics before her. Well, that just shows you
have never met Mr Murphy, seen his smile, or
come under the profound power of his suasion.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c013'>“We are near Tullagh,” said Mr Fanshawe.
“I recognise that row of trees. Look! there’s
the railway line and the station. The train
either hasn’t arrived, or it’s gone. I can’t tell
the time, I haven’t my watch.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Put your head out,” said Violet.</p>

<p class='c013'>He did so.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Patsy!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You can’t see the train?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, sir; but it hasn’t come, we’ve tin minits
to the good.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How do you know?” shouted Mr Fanshawe</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve got your watch an’ chain, sir,” came
Patsy’s voice. “I whipped it out of Paddy’s
pocket whin he was playin’ tricks wid the ould
Gineral and the handkerchief wid your money
wrapped up in it. Mr Fanshawe, sir!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve counted the gowld, it’s all there—six
suverins; and there’s fourteen shillings of Paddy’s
as well.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We must take Patsy with us,” said Mr
Fanshawe, when he had communicated the news
to his companions.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I always said Patsy was a brick,” said little
Lord Gawdor. “Didn’t I, Doris?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” said Doris. “Here’s the station, and
there’s the station man with a lantern in his hand.”</p>

<p class='c013'><i>“The dear children went back in the carriage,”
wrote Mrs Fanshawe, six weeks later to a girl
friend. “I could never have imagined an experience
so awful and—so lovely; and the strange thing
is, every one is so pleased, even old General Grampound
has consented to write. It was an abusive
letter, but even that’s a lot for him. I’m sure he
has a good heart—somewhere.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>I got such a lovely emerald pendant from
Lady Seagrave; and, fancy, she was going to have
given me a grebe muff and a prayer-book for Christmas.
Little Bob told me, and I think that was
partly why I ran away.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Poor dear Mr Murphy is going to America.
Dicky is getting him out of the country through
a friend. He says he’s taken an office for him in
Wall Street, wherever that is. Dicky is so good—you
can’t think.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>We have Patsy with us; he has just been
giving a French boy what he calls ‘buther’ in
the courtyard of the hotel. Dicky says he got the
remains of the French boy away from him just in
time.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>He is always fighting, but Dicky says that
as long as there is a bit of him left he never intends
to part with Patsy.</i>”</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
